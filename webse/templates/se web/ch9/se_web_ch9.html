            <p>
                Galvanic cells also called voltaic cells are devices that use a <strong>chemical reaction to produce electricity</strong>.
                As in the chapter where we study hydrogen, the chemical reaction used to produce electricity is the 
                <strong>oxidation-reduction reaction</strong>.
                </br>
                </br>
                Galvanic cells (voltaic cells) are very popular, since <strong>batteries</strong> work by using the same principle.
                The batteries have chemicals that react together in an oxidation-reduction reaction to produce electricity.
                </br>
                </br>
                Before to explain the chemical reaction that generates electricity, we introduce the
                    <strong>parts of a voltaic cell</strong> (Figure: Voltaic cell (oxidation-reduction process)).

                            One of the containers has a <strong>zinc-sulfate solution</strong> (ZnSO4). The other container has
                            a <strong>copper-sulfate solution</strong> (CuSO4).

                            We have a <strong>piece of zinc metal</strong> in the zinc-sulfate solution (ZnSO4), and a
                            <strong>piece of copper metal</strong> in the copper-sulfate solution (CuSO4).
                            </br>
                            </br>
                            In the electrochemical series, there are metals that have a <strong>high tendency to lose electrons</strong>
                            (Li(3.04V), Mg(2.37V), Al(1.66V), Zn(0.76V), Fe(0.44V)); and others metals that have a
                            <strong>high tendency to gain electrons</strong> (Hg(-0,24V), Cu(-0.34V), Ag(-1.69V)).
                            </br>
                            </br>
                            The idea behind a battery is to connect metals with tendency to lose electrons with metals with
                            tendency to gain electrons to generate an electric current.

                We explain how voltaic cells work. We divide the entire process in two steps. First, we explain the 
                <strong>oxidation-reduction process</strong>. Second, we explain the role of <strong>salt bridge</strong> in the entire
                process. By splitting the process in two parts, we will make easier to understand the entire process. 
                Moreover, this will also help us to know how do lithium-ion batteries work (next section).

                            the container full of electrons (electrons repeal each other).

                        <li>
                            To avoid that the flow of electrons stops, a <strong>salt bridge</strong> is used to maintain the
                            charge of the zinc-sulfate (ZnSO4) and the copper-sulfate  (CuSO4) solutions neutral.
                            The salt bridge contains chlorine Cl- and sodium Na+.
	                        </br>
                            </br>
	                        The Chlorine Cl- move to the container where the oxidation takes place (anode), and the sodium Na+ moves
                            to the container where the reduction takes place (cathode). By doing that, the zinc-sulfate  
                            (ZnSO4) and the copper-sulfate (CuSO4)  solutions are balanced and the flow of
                            electrons can continue.

                As voltaic cells, lithium-ion batteries use a <strong>chemical reaction to produce electricity</strong>.
                </br>
                </br>
                Before to explain the chemical reaction that generates electricity, we introduce the
                <strong>parts of a voltaic cell</strong> (Figure: Lithium-ion battery (oxidation-reduction process)).
            </p>

                        <li>
                            There are <strong>two electrodes</strong>. The <strong>anode</strong> is a structure that combines carbon and 
                            lithium (LiC6) (lithium-graphite structure). The <strong>cathode</strong> is a structure that
                            combines cobalt and Oxygen (CoO2) (oxido(oxo)-cobalt).
                            </br>
                            </br>
                            The lithium has a high tendency to lose electrons. The cobalt combined with the oxygen has a 
                            high tendency to gain electrons.
                            </br>
                            </br>
                            An electric current is generated by connecting the structure that contains (LiC6) (anode),
                            and the structure that contains (CoO2) (cathode).
                        </li>
                        </br>
                        <li>
                            A <strong>metal wire</strong> connects the structures (LiC6) and (CoO2).
                        </li>
                        </br>
                        <li>
                            Finally, a <strong>electrolyte</strong> connects the two structures. The electrolyte plays a similar
                            role to the salt bridge in the voltaic cells, since it leaves to pass lithium-ions (Li+) 
                            to balance the charge in the anode and the cathode to facilitate the flow of electrons.

            <p>
                We explain how voltaic cells work. We divide the entire process in two steps. First, we explain the
                <strong>oxidation-reduction process</strong>. Second, we explain the role of <strong>electrolyte</strong> in
                the entire process.

                            Due to the oxidation-reduction reaction, the charge in the electrodes changes, and that

                  <p class="text-right">
                        According to the Centre for Solar Energy and Hydrogen
                        Research Baden-Württemberg (ZSW), 5.6 million EVs
                        were on the world’s roads at the beginning of 2019. <strong>China
                            and the United States (US)</strong> are the largest markets, with
                        2.6 million and 1.1 million EVs, respectively. On average,
                        EV sales grew rapidly during the period 2012 to 2017,
                        with a <strong>compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 57%</strong>.
                        However, the market is still in an incipient phase, with
                        EVs representing only 1.3% of all light-duty vehicles sold
                        in 2017.
                        </br>
                        </br>
                        The <strong>Chinese</strong> EV market has experienced the largest
                        increase in sales, with a CAGR of 114% between 2012
                        and 2017. In 2015 China surpassed the US in total
                        EV sales, and in 2017 it was responsible for 48% of
                        worldwide electric light-duty vehicle sales. The Chinese
                        government has offered direct monetary incentives
                        to support the purchase of EVs, including one-time
                        subsidies and purchase tax exemptions, as well as
                        non-monetary incentives, such as restrictions on
                        registrations for ICE vehicles.
                        </br>
                        </br>
                        After China and the US, the next largest markets are in
                        <strong>Europe</strong>, with considerable growth in EV sales from 2012
                        to 2017 in Germany (CAGR of 75%), Norway (70%) and
                        the UK (68%). Figure: Evolution EV sales (2012-2017) shows the evolution of EV sales
                        in the 10 countries that represented 88% of worldwide
                        electric light-duty vehicle sales in 2017.

                        Although the Chinese and US markets are the largest
                        for EV sales, other countries have had greater success in
                        integrating EVs into their overall vehicle fleets. Figure: Evolution EV sales (2012-2017)
                        shows the evolution of market <strong>penetration of EVs</strong> in
                        light-duty vehicle sales. <strong>Norway</strong> has made remarkable
                        progress since 2012, becoming a global leader with an
                        almost 40% share of EVs in 2017. This was the result
                        of a favourable policy environment in recent years
                        comprising a large range of incentives, from tax breaks
                        and exemptions to waivers on road tolls and ferry fees.

                        After Norway, the markets with the highest progress in
                        EV integration between 2012 and 2017 were <strong>Sweden</strong>, the
                        <strong>US</strong> and the <strong>Netherlands</strong>, with EV shares representing
                        5.1%, 3.3% and 2.7%, respectively, of the light-duty
                        vehicle market in 2017. The remaining six largest markets
                        did not exceed ratios of 2.5% of EV penetration and rank
                        similarly to the global average.

                        charging infrastructure. In its first several months,

                        IKEA Group and the Chinese Internet giant Baidu (The
                        Climate Group, 2017). <strong>Vattenfall</strong> has the most timeambitious
                        goal of the initiative so far, with the company
                        setting targets to shift its fleets (3 500 light-duty
                        vehicles) to 100% electric by 2022 as part of its goal
                        to be climate neutral by 2050. The replacement will
                        take five years and will include fleets in Germany, the
                        Netherlands and Sweden.

                        The <strong>French postal service</strong> La Poste is also a pioneer
                        in the field, owning 35 000 EVs out of a total fleet of
                        75 000 vehicles. In 2017 <strong>Germany’s
                            Deutsche Post DHL Group </strong>also set a target to achieve
                        zero-emission logistics by 2050, in part through the use
                        of EVs.

                  <p class="text-right">
                        The market for e-buses is concentrated mainly in<strong> Asia
                            Pacific</strong>, where a market penetration of 27.6% was
                        reached in 2016. Since 2014 there has been a large
                        uptake of e-buses in <strong>China</strong>, which is now responsible
                        for 99% of the worldwide sales and fleet. Market
                        penetration in <strong>North America and Western Europe</strong> is
                        around 0.6%. Whereas China reached 340 000 e-buses
                        in 2017, the largest fleet of e-buses in Europe is in the UK
                        and accounts for only 344 units.

                        <strong>China</strong> is at the leading edge of the electrification of
                        public transport buses because of the air pollution
                        problems in its cities and industrial zones. The strategy
                        of electrifying public transport comes from city
                        administrations that want to reduce air pollution. The
                        rapid and strong uptake of e-buses in Shenzen, for
                        example, has helped to dramatically reduce the city’s
                        greenhouse gas emissions. The shift to e-buses is also
                        supported by the national government, which has huge
                        ambitions in mass transit. Apart from electrification,
                        China has invested in a national high-speed railway
                        network, subways and bus rapid transit.

                        </br>
                        In <strong>Europe</strong>, the number of e-buses is expected to
                        grow considerably in the coming years. At least 19
                        public transport operators and municipalities in 25
                        European cities have outlined e-bus strategies for 2020.

            <h3>EV flexibility potential</h3>
            
            <p>
                The uptake of smart charging for electric mobility is
                expected to establish a positive feedback loop with
                the integration of renewables, given that e-mobility is
                a power-dense, mobile and controllable load. Studies
                have shown that <strong>cars in general, including EVs, are
                    parked for about 95% of their lifetime</strong>. This, combined with their storage capacity, could
                make <strong>EVs an attractive flexibility solution to support
                    system operation</strong>. They can become grid-connected
                storage units with a potential to provide a broad range
                of services to the system. In 2050, around 14 TWh of EV batteries would
                be available to provide grid services, compared to
                9 TWh of stationary batteries (IRENA, 2019b).
            </p>

            <!--Text-Image-->
            <div class="text_image_css">
                <div>
                    The typical electricity consumption of an EV driving
                    15 000 km/year is about 3 000 kWh/year. Even with
                    slow charging (i.e., charging with low power, say 3.7 kW),
                    the total time needed to charge the yearly energy is
                    about 10% of the time the car stands idle. Supposing
                    that an EV is connected to charging infrastructure 100%
                    of its parking time, this means that the yearly <strong>“flexibility
                        window” for charging represents about 85% of the time</strong>.
                    Theoretically, this would translate into a flexible energy
                    output of about 3 000 kWh/year per car. In other words,
                    EVs can be charged in a fraction of their parking time.
                    Incentivising charging at times when electricity is the
                    cheapest represents a significant opportunity for the
                    power system and for EV owners.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    In practice, flexibility can be lower due to drivers’ time
                    constraints, with fast charging, or when the vehicle
                    is parked but not plugged in. The different factors
                    that determine the amount of available flexible (dis-)
                    charging energy from EVs available in the system are
                    summarised in Figure: Factors determining available flexibility from a single EV.

            <h4>EVs providing power system flexibility today</h4>

            <p>
                Today, the EV fleet is very limited and the cars still have
                relatively small batteries. EVs can already help maximise
                self-consumption of on-site renewable production.
                However, the flexibility that EVs provide to the grid is
                limited. Their aggregated storage capacity today is
                marginal from a power system perspective.
                </br>
                </br>
                How long the car can be connected to the grid depends
                on the immobilisation time, which is determined by the
                type of vehicle and its use. Taxis or buses that travel a
                high daily distance will have less immobilisation time
                and therefore less flexibility than single cars used by
                individuals. While an <strong>electric bus or truck</strong> may use 100%
                or more of battery capacity every day, <strong>passenger cars
                    and two-wheelers</strong> may use 40% to 50% of it.

                <u>When and where.</u>
                </br>
                </br>
                When and where the vehicle is charged also depends on
                the car type, its use, the <strong>geography</strong> and the <strong>availability
                    of the infrastructure</strong>:

                            charging takes place at home during the evening,
                            and at night and at the workplace during the day.
                            EV drivers without home charging need assigned
                            workplace charging.

                            to 1 hour) charging provide minimum flexibility for
                            the system and are ill-suited for grid services: fast
                            charging on highways is rather exceptional today
                            as EVs are mostly not yet used for long trips (due
                            mainly to the limited range issue and the lack of
                            appropriate charging infrastructure).

                        depending on the business models. Nevertheless,
                        the transport service revenue is critical and the time
                        of standing still should be reduced to a minimum,

                Depending on the <strong>geography</strong> and specifically the access
                to a <strong>private parking space at the residential level</strong>, the
                proportions among the charging locations might differ. In
                less densely populated areas, most of the charging cycles
                are performed at home or at work. In densely populated
                cities with no charging points at home or at work, a larger
                proportion of the charging could be done in public places
                in the city. Large parking spaces or bus depots have more
                technical opportunities and incentives to contribute to
                energy flexibility than do disperse charging locations.

            <h4>EVs providing power system flexibility by 2030</h4>

            <p>
                By 2030 individual ownership of vehicles will most likely
                still prevail over car sharing. As a result, an <strong>increase in
                    flexibility</strong> can be expected:

                <ul>
                <li><strong>More EVs available to the grid due to falling cost</strong>:
                EVs get cheaper due to falling battery cost and
                government policies, as outlined in the previous
                section.</li>
                </br>
                <li><strong>Bigger batteries helping to overcome range
                    anxiety</strong>: there will be more EVs with larger batteries
                connected to the grid. Battery packs will be bigger –
                increasing from 20-30 kWh currently to 40-60 kWh,
                with ranges of around 300 km becoming widespread
                in the next two years and growing even further.</li>

                <li><strong>Cars, charging stations and smart charging and
                    discharging functionalities</strong>: as standardisation
                progresses and as the requirements for better
                control of the charging power increase, the vehicles
                and charging points will have smart charging options
                including discharging as a common feature (provided
                by auto manufacturers), and technically enabling
                provision of ancillary services to the grid.</li>
                </br>

                <li><strong>Fast charging</strong> will remain limited as drivers will use
                it mainly for long-distance trips and for necessary
                top-ups given that enough range is available and as
                long as charging at home remains cheaper. While
                higher nominal charging capacity generally increases
                the challenge of uncontrolled charging, daytime fast
                charging could be aligned with grid needs in areas with
                high solar production during the day.</li>

            <h4>EVs providing power system flexibility by 2050</h4>

            <p>
                Between 2030 and 2050, this picture could <strong>change
                    substantially</strong>. Mobility business models such as <strong>mobilityas-
                    a-service (MaaS)</strong> – i.e., seamless multimodal transport
                – and technologies such as <strong>autonomous vehicles </strong>may
                emerge and be broadly implemented, leading to a
                shift from individual ownership of vehicles to fleet
                management.
                </br>
                </br>
                Studies have shown that “ride-sharing” could lead to
                an <strong>increase in the number of kilometres</strong> driven as
                the shift from public transport towards shared private
                transport occurs at a larger scale. However, it also should
                lead to lower use of private cars with low passenger
                occupancy, which could in turn imply a reduction in the
                net emissions of the transport system.
                </br>
                </br>
                Nevertheless, downwards pressure on available
                flexibility is likely to occur under this scenario, as:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Distance travelled by individual cars would increase</strong>,
                    reducing the amount of time that they are idle,
                    connected to the grid.</li>
                    </br>
                    <li>MaaS will also eventually impact the number of
                    EVs in the system. The increase in <strong>EV sales would
                        slow down</strong>: under the assumption that the EV
                    revolution will precede the advent of an advanced
                    MaaS ecosystem, new business models in MaaS
                    will translate to downwards pressure on car sales
                    for individuals after approximately 2030, following
                    years of increasing market growth.</li>
                    </br>
                    <li><strong>Zones of strain on the local power grid can be created
                        once charging is focused in hubs</strong>. These hubs may
                    be relevant for centralised flexibility management in
                    the night but still probably lower than with individual
                    car ownership, as transport service optimisation
                    will aim at maximum usage. Vehicle fleets will have
                    to be steered towards an optimised fleet charging
                    and routing, contributing to the goals of EV grid
                    integration and optimised renewable energy use.</li>

            <h3>Impact on electricity capacity and demand</h3>
            <p>
                If EVs were charged simultaneously in an uncontrolled
                way they could increase the peak demand on the grid,
                contributing to overloading and the need for upgrades
                at the distribution level. The extra load may even result
                in the need for upgrades in the generation capacity
                (or at least in an altered production cost profile). The
                extent of possible impacts would depend on the power
                system’s electricity mix, grid typology and penetration
                of EVs, as demonstrated by various trials and studies
                conducted globally.
                </br>
                </br>
                The studies converge on <strong>three main conclusions</strong> about
                the <strong>impacts of EVs on the power system</strong> and how these
                impacts can be mitigated:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Impact on electricity demand</strong> will be limited:
                        <ul>
                            <li>In a 100% electric mobility scenario for Europe, the
                            energy needs of EVs might represent no more than
                            10% to 15% of total electricity production. However,
                            EV grid integration might lead to local power issues
                            with increasing EV volumes (Eurelectric, 2015).</li>
                            </br>
                            <li>If all 2.7 million cars in Norway were EVs, they
                            would only use 5-6% of the country’s annual
                            hydropower output.</li>
                            </br>
                            <li>In a 25% electric mobility scenario for Germany, 10
                            million EVs by 2035 would translate to an overall
                            consumption increase of only 2.5-3%.</li>
                            </br>
                            <li>If all light-duty vehicles in the US were electric,
                            they would have represented about 24% of the
                            total electricity demand in the country in 2016.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    </br>
                    <li>
                        The <strong>impact on peak demand</strong>, however, can be much
                        greater if the additional demand is not distributed
                        smartly. For this, smart charging is key:
                        <ul>
                            <li>In a 10 million EV scenario for the UK by 2035,
                            evening peak demand increases by 3 GW if
                            charging is uncontrolled, but increases by only
                            0.5 GW if charging is smart. With smart EV
                            charging, the lowest price periods could see
                            demand increase by 7 GW.</li>
                            </br>
                            <li>Modelling of EVs in New England showed that
                            a 25% share of EVs in the system charged in an
                            uncontrolled fashion would increase peak demand
                            by 19%, requiring significant investment in grid and
                            generation capacities. However, by spreading the
                            load over the evening hours, the increase in peak
                            demand could be cut to between 0% and 6%. And
                            charging only at off-peak hours could avoid any
                            increase at all in peak demand.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    </br>
                    <li>
                        The <strong>impact on local distribution grids</strong> might also be
                        significant if not managed with smart charging:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Xcel Energy, Colorado in the US demonstrated
                            that 4% of distribution transformers could be
                            overloaded at EV market penetration of 5% if
                            charging is aligned with peak load times.</li>
                            </br>
                            <li>The My Electric Avenue Project in the UK identified
                            a need for 32% of distribution circuit upgrades with
                            a 40-70% share of electrified cars.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>

            <h3>Impact on grid infrastructure</h3>

            <p>
                EV charging will have an impact on <strong>distribution grid
                    investments</strong>. The scope of grid investments (in terms
                of cables and transformers) that will need to be made
                in a given location will depend at least on the following
                parameters:
                <!--Ordered list-->
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Congestion:</strong> such as in the local distribution network
                    prior to any EV deployment.</li>
                    </br>
                    <li><strong>Simultaneity factor:</strong> as applied based on the size of
                    each distribution grid. The simultaneity factor/coefficient
                    measures the probability that a particular
                    piece of equipment will need to be switched on at
                    the same time as another piece of equipment. Every
                    distribution system operator considers a different
                    simultaneity factor.</li>
                    </br>
                    <li><strong>Load characteristics:</strong> for example, the impact of
                    uncontrolled EV charging will be higher in locations
                    with high shares of electric heating (thus leading to
                    higher grid reinforcement). But if smart charging
                    is used in such locations, it may be included with
                    lower grid reinforcements than in locations where
                    no electric heating is used, as the local grids are
                    dimensioned for higher peaks.</li>
                    </br>
                    <li><strong>Generation assets connected at low voltage level:</strong>
                    for example, integration of high shares of solar PV
                    connected at low voltage level (e.g., in Germany)
                    could be facilitated with smart charging, whereas in
                    locations with no or very low shares of solar PV, EVs
                    could increase the strain on local grids.</li>
                    </br>
                    <li><strong>Grid code limits and other regulations:</strong> for
                    example, national grid codes define physical
                    constraints in terms of both voltage and frequency

            <strong>Fast charging represents a challenge for grid
                infrastructure development</strong>. The higher the power, the
            more capacity you need from the distribution grid. In
            addition, the locally deployed charging station/cables and vehicle must support this power. Both of those are
            technologically feasible but come at a price:

                    <u>EV charging impact on Hamburg's distribution grid.</u>
			        </br>
                    </br>
                    Hamburg is currently the city with the highest number of charging points in Germany (several hundred
                    charging points in households and 810 public charging points as of November 2018). The city expected to
                    install 1 000 public charging points by the beginning of 2019. Electrification of public buses and EV growth
                    are the most critical drivers of load development in the city. The majority of EVs will be in the suburbs where,
                    in Hamburg’s case, the grid is weaker.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    The local distribution system operator, Stromnetz Hamburg, ran a load development analysis to identify
                    critical situations for uncontrolled charging of EVs with charging point loads of 11 kW and 22 kW.<strong> A 9% EV
                        share, corresponding to 60 000 EVs loading in private infrastructure, will cause bottlenecks in 15% of the
                        feeders in the city’s distribution network</strong>.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    To avoid these critical situations, Stromnetz Hamburg assessed that investment needs for reinforcing the
                    local grids would reach at least EUR 20 million. Stromnetz Hamburg is also exploring alternative solutions to
                    address the problem. The key is to decrease the simultaneity, meaning decreasing the number of EVs that
                    are charged at the same time on the same local grid. For that, a smart solution using digital technologies is
                    being tested, which includes a real-time communication system that enables the distribution system operator
                    to reduce the load of the charging points needed to address the problem. The 11 kW charging points, for
                    example, can reduce their load from 16 amperes (A) to 8 A, allowing EVs to be charged but in a longer period
                    of time.

            <h3>Services provided by smartly charged EVs </h3>
            <p>
                Smart charging using vehicle-grid integration (VGI)
                technologies is a means of managing EV loads. This is
                done either by customers responding to price signals,
                by the Electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) automated response to control signals
                that react to the grid and market situations, or by a
                combination of the two while respecting customers’
                needs for vehicle availability. It consists of shifting
                some charging cycles in time or modulating the power
                in function of constraints (e.g., connection capacity,
                user needs, real-time local energy production). Smart
                charging therefore is a way of optimising the charging
                process according to distribution grid constraints
                and local renewable energy availability, as well as the
                preferences of drivers and EVSE site hosts.

                    If charged smartly, EVs can not only avoid adding stress
                    to the local grid but also provide services to fill flexibility
                    gaps both on the local level and on the system level
                    (Figure: Potential range of flexibility services by EVs).
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    The EVs can operate as grid-connected storage units
                    with a potential to provide a broad range of services to
                    the system. They could alternate their charging patterns
                    to flatten peak demand, fill load valleys and support
                    real-time balancing of grids by adjusting their charging
                    levels.

                    </br>
                    Smart charging not only mitigates EV-caused demand
                    peaks but also flattens the load curve to better integrate
                    VRE, both at the system level and locally, at the shorter
                    term
                    time scales. More specifically, adjusting charging
                    patterns that today stand idle in parking for most of
                    the time (90-95% of the time for most cars) could

            <h3>Types of smart charging and their implementation</h3>

            <p>
                Smart charging includes different pricing and technical
                charging options. The basic technical options are
                summarised in Figure: Forms of smart charging.

                Direct control mechanisms enabled by the EV and
                the charging point will be necessary as a long-term
                solution at higher penetration levels and for delivery
                of close-to-real-time balancing and ancillary services. Such mechanisms range from basic switching on and
                off of the charging or unidirectional control of vehicles
                or EVSE (<strong>also called V1G</strong>) that allows for an increase or
                decrease in the rate of charging, to more challenging
                bidirectional <strong>vehicle-to-everything (V2X)</strong>.

                    For <strong>V2X</strong>, two specific configurations are particularly
                    relevant:

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Vehicle-to-home (V2H)</strong> or <strong>vehicle-to-building (V2B)</strong>
                        do not typically directly affect grid performance.
                        The EV is used as a residential back-up power supply
                        during periods of power outage or for increasing self consumption
                        of energy produced on-site (demand
                        charge avoidance).</li>
                        </br>
                        <li><strong>Vehicle-to-grid (V2G)</strong> refers to providing services
                        to the grid in the discharge mode. The utility /
                        transmission system operator may be willing to
                        purchase energy from customers during periods of
                        peak demand, and/or to use the EV battery capacity
                        for providing ancillary services, such as balancing
                        and frequency control, including primary frequency
                        regulation and secondary reserve.</li>

            <p>
                In the
                <strong>V1G</strong>, the driver, the EV charging site host or the
                aggregator can be rewarded only for adjusting their
                rate of charging up and down compared to the initial
                charging power (3 kW is assumed for illustration). In
                <strong>V2G</strong>, EVs can charge and discharge electricity from
                and to the grid, respectively. The size of the “bids” for
                grid services corresponds to the capabilities of the EV
                and the requirements in the given market.

            <h2>Business models</h2>

            <h3>E-mobility market actors</h3>
            <p>
                The e-mobility market includes the <strong>following segments</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>EV sales</strong>: while most light-duty vehicles are sold via
                    leasing, public procurement needs to be considered
                    for public transport means such as buses.</li>
                    </br>
                    <li><strong>Mobility services</strong>: these services include e-car
                    sharing, intermodal transport, fleet management,
                    electromobility service provision and, increasingly,
                    collection and analytics of data from drivers, fleet
                    managers and charging stations.</li>
                    </br>
                    <li><strong>Electricity sales to power EVs</strong>: this includes
                    electricity retail sales as well as re-selling by charging
                    infrastructure providers.</li>
                    </br>
                    <li>Installation and maintenance of charging
                    infrastructure.</li>
                    </br>
                    <li><strong>Charging station operations</strong> (smart charging / data
                    management / billing).</li>
                    </br>
                    <li>E-roaming: this is key for interoperability of charging
                    services as well as regional/national charging
                    independence.</li>
                    </br>
                    <li><strong>Advanced grid services</strong> such as aggregation and
                    V2G (emerging).</li>
                </ul>
                Many traditional as well as new actors from both the
                mobility and energy sectors are active in this emerging
                market. In addition to Tesla – with its vision of an
                integrated mobility company stirring change in the sector
                – new independent providers include<strong> e-car-sharing service providers</strong> (e.g., Zen Car and BlueIndy by Bolloré),
                dedicated charging <strong>station developers</strong>, <strong>operators</strong>, <strong>data
                    managers</strong>, <strong>e-roaming platform providers</strong>, as well as
                providers and aggregators of advanced grid services.
            </p>

            <h3>Smart energy services provider and aggregator</h3>

            <p>
                The business model of monitoring and controlling large
                number of resources together by aggregating them and
                selling their energy and/or capacity in the wholesale or
                ancillary services markets has been maturing for larger
                loads and distributed generation. However, <strong>aggregation
                    of batteries from EVs</strong> and offering services that EVs
                can provide to the market have not yet been fully
                commercialised.
                </br>
                </br>                
                <strong>Profitability and competitiveness of EV
                    flexibility</strong> with other flexibility sources at the system
                level remains a key issue:
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Price spreads</strong> in the system may be lowered –
                    for example, by daytime solar PV generation – and
                    may not rise again if there is sufficient flexibility in
                    the system (low price spreads are expected in the
                    German and Spanish day-ahead markets, but high
                    ones are expected in the UK market).</li>
                    </br>
                    <li><strong>Revenues from ancillary services</strong> may not
                    provide sufficient flexibility in all markets.  For instance, the calculation for
                    Germany was based on a market volume of primary
                    and secondary control of EUR 265 million for 2015,
                    assuming 10 million EVs with 90% availability,
                    representing a value of EUR 29 per EV per year.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    Notably, the demand for these services is currently
                    limited to 660 MW, and these 10 million EVs would
                    represent an approximate volume of 30 000 MW,
                    thus pushing the prices even lower.</li>
                    </br>
                    <li><strong>EVs will compete with other types of
                        decentralised flexibility such as demand-response
                        resources</strong>, and with the used EV batteries themselves.
                    Second-life EV batteries will be inexpensive and are
                    already being deployed by automakers today.</li>

                        done via a <strong>software-as-a-service (SaaS) structure</strong>, which
                        could manage numerous charging points and other
                        loads on a site. Alternatively, it can be implemented
                        locally as within the charging infrastructure (e.g., local

                      <strong>Virtual Power Plant </strong>operator Next Kraftwerke, and Jedlix,
                        an electric vehicle (EV) aggregator and smart charging
                        platform provider, have launched an international pilot
                        project which uses EV batteries to deliver secondary
                        control reserve to TennET, the transmission system
                        operator in Netherlands. By connecting the EV to the Jedlix platform, Jedlix can coordinate user charging
                        preferences and establish a live connection with the
                        EV, making sure they are charged smartly. Depending
                        on the charging preference, each EV can provide
                        either positive or negative control reserves. Jedlix will
                        be able to combine user preferences, car data, and
                        charging station information to provide a continuous
                        forecast of the available capacity. This is then used by
                        Next Kraftwerke in the bidding process of TenneT for
                        procuring grid services (NextKraftwerke, 2018).

                  <p class="text-right">
                      The current <strong>Vehicle-grid integration (VGI)</strong> is based largely on the provision of
                        charging management software from developers of
                        proprietary solutions (like AutoGrid or Nuvve) to utilities
                        and fleets, sometimes operated by Original equipment manufacturer (OEMs). The energy
                        services platform provider model is no longer B2B but
                        integrates the software and provides a spectrum of B2C services. The case studies of Enel and Nissan (green box below)
                        illustrate this emerging business strategy from the utility
                        and the OEM perspectives, respectively.

                        into other platforms and by other actors from
                        other sub-sectors. For example, <strong>smart building
                            “as-a-service”</strong> integrating energy management is
                        gaining traction, and collecting data from occupants,

                        next step, even if not the current focus. This space is
                        currently dominated by electronics giants (Schneider
                        Electric, Siemens, Panasonic). Siemens is using its
                        building automation system Desigo in a research

                    <u>Future energy services platform providers: Enel and Nissan strategies</u>
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    In addition to developing charging infrastructure and bundled offers for home and public charging, Enel has
                    invested in the development of an accessible DC V2X home charging station that charges and discharges at
                    10 kW. Enel has participated in various pilot projects – for example, in the pilot with Nissan in the UK they have
                    played the role of electricity supplier at the charging point, charging software provider as well as aggregator.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    In this pilot, <strong>EV clients received compensation</strong> in the form of a reduction in their electricity bill in exchange
                    for provision of grid services, and, thanks to smart energy service, they locally optimise their consumption by
                    increasing self-consumption of their locally generated solar energy and saving on the network charges. Enel
                    integrated the purchased V2G power into its <strong>larger aggregated ancillary services portfolio</strong>, thus creating a
                    “buffer” for uncertainties due to possible deviations in the schedules of individual vehicles, without directly
                    controlling them. Enel is paid by the transmission and distribution system operators and shares the value with
                    the client.
                    </br>
                    </br>                    
                    The automaker <strong>Nissan</strong> also eyes valorisation of aggregated flexibility as an additional revenue stream. In
                    January 2018 Nissan launched a new solar generation and energy storage system for domestic use in the
                    UK (Nissan, 2018). The automaker claims that its solution will allow UK homeowners to <strong>increase the rate of
                        self-consumption </strong>from on-site PV and cut energy bills by up to 66%. Over 880 000 UK homes already have
                    solar panels and the market is growing. This new product is a further extension of <strong>xStorage Home</strong> that Nissan
                    developed in partnership with Eaton with second-life EV batteries.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    In October 2017 Nissan announced a partnership with OVO Energy to launch a new offering combining
                    the VNet capability of OVO with Nissan’s xStorage Home system to develop an OVO SolarStore and a V2G
                    offering for private customers buying the latest Nissan LEAF (OVO Energy, 2017).

            <h2>E-mobility outlook</h2>

            <h3>Cost and competitiveness of EVs</h3>
            <p>
                Until now, the most crucial factor that has led to a
                substantial cost decrease for EVs in the last few years
                is the<strong> decline in battery pack costs</strong>. Improvements in
                battery technologies have reduced the average price of
                battery packs from USD 1 000/kWh in 2010 to around
                USD 200/kWh in 2017 (UCS, 2017). Analysts expect a
                further decrease in price to levels of USD 100/kWh in
                2025 (McKinsey, 2014), which in turn would result in EVs
                being competitive with ICE vehicles. As a rule of thumb,
                this total cost of ownership parity between EVs and
                conventional gasoline vehicles will be reached at battery
                prices of around EUR 175/kWh (UCS, 2017).
                </br>
                </br>
                Another notable factor that has helped to reduce EV
                prices over the years is the increasing<strong> variety of models</strong>
                being offered in the market. Whereas in 2010 early
                customers interested in EVs could choose among only
                a few limited options – such as the Nissan LEAF, the
                Citroën C-Zero, etc. – today the range of models is more
                extensive.
            </p>

            <!--Text-Image-->
            <div class="text_image_css">
                <div>
                    <u>Total cost of ownership (TCO) comparison.</u>
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    Figure: Total cost of ownership cars shows how the total cost of ownership (TCO) of diesel and EVs could
                    evolve until 2050. The graph, although illustrative, aims
                    to emphasise that in the medium term (the second half
                    of the 2020s) EVs will eventually be more competitive
                    than diesel vehicles even without subsidies and taxes.
                    If that is the case, EVs could reach a global flee
                    penetration of 7%(IEA, 2018a).
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    The continued decrease in TCO is supported by the
                    same trends described earlier and can be strengthened
                    by<strong> two more observations</strong>. On the one hand, because of
                    <strong>new mobility business models</strong> oriented to car-sharing
                    practices that are expected by 2050, there will be a
                    shift from privately owned cars to shared vehicles. This will inevitably increase the EV
                    utilisation rate to ranges from 40 000 to 55 000 km per
                    year, and will in turn increase the EV’s fuel cost savings
                    in comparison with a diesel car driving the same yearly
                    mileage.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    On the other hand, an<strong> unknown variable is how quickly
                        the TCO of EVs will go down in comparison with diesel
                        vehicles</strong>. This point could be influenced by the recent
                    and upcoming wave of countries setting <strong>bans on fossil
                        fuel vehicle sales</strong> by as early as 2025 (in the Netherlands)
                    or by 2030 to 2040 (in France and the UK).

            <h3>Outlook of batteries</h3>
            
            <p>
                While <strong>Li-on
                    will probably remain the prevalent technology until
                    2030</strong>, potential breakthroughs in other technologies
                may lead to its replacement in the long-term horizon.
                </br>
                </br>                
                Two technologies that have already been commercialised
                – for example, as minor technologies in e-buses for
                around 10 years – are <strong>Zeolite Battery Research Africa
                    (ZEBRA)</strong> and <strong>lithium-metal-polymer (LMP)</strong> battery
                technologies.
                </br>
                </br>
                <strong>Other technologies </strong>with lower maturity levels are
                currently under development (only cells are sold, not
                systems) and could be potentially disruptive if their
                issues are solved, including:

                <ul>
                    <li>Li-ion systems with silicon (Si) as a negative electrode</li>
                    </br>
                    <li>Lithium-sulphur system (Li-S)</li>
                    </br>
                    <li>Sodium-ion batteries (Na-ion), which are raising
                    interest due to the potential low cost and
                    environmental friendliness</li>
                    </br>
                    <li>Metal-air batteries including aluminium-air (Al-air)
                    and zinc-air (Zn-air)</li>
                    </br>
                    <li>Redox flow batteries for mobility applications.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Shared e-mobility: Mobility-as-a-service</h3>

            <p>
                Changing mobility needs will lead to the rise of business
                models that could transform mobility systems over
                the coming decades. Removing the pain points that
                travellers face during their journeys could prove to be
                a crucial opportunity for new businesses to appeal to
                customers. A new concept is already paving the way
                for these business opportunities to emerge, via a shift
                from an ownership-centred approach of transport to
                mobility options that are consumed as a service. This
                service-centred mobility is called <strong>mobility as-a-service
                (MaaS)</strong>.
            </p>

            <div class="text_image_css">
                <img
                src="{{url_for('static', filename='figures/se/ch9/EV_mobility_as_service.svg')}}"
                        alt=""/>
                <div>
                    Mobility-as-a-service is a way to seamlessly combine
                    transport alternatives from various providers (including
                    shared mobility providers but beyond). MaaS goes
                    beyond calculating the fastest path from one place to another and instead offers a one-stop shop for
                    everything from optimised travel itineraries to payments.
                    A MaaS offering thus consists of <strong>four complementary
                        functionalities</strong>: <strong>trip planning</strong>, <strong>booking</strong>, <strong>payment</strong> and
                    <strong>ticketing/billing</strong>.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    At the centre of the MaaS design are <strong>four main actors</strong>,
                    each of them having a key role in providing the MaaS
                    offering. These actors are the <strong>customers</strong>, the <strong>MaaS
                        providers</strong>, the <strong>data providers</strong> and the <strong>transport operators</strong> (Figure: Simplified mobility-as-a-service value chain).
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    Although customers have progressively
                    adopted new mobility possibilities over the last decade,
                    and while transport operators are already in place in
                    many countries, MaaS providers and data providers
                    remain almost non-existent. The following section and
                    Figure 28 clarify the value that each step of the value
                    chain offers to the customer.
