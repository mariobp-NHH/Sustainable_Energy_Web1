                        As more countries pursue deep decarbonisation strategies, hydrogen will have a critical role to play.
                        This will be particularly so where direct electrification is challenging and in harder-to-abate sectors,
                        such as steel, chemicals, long-haul transport, shipping and aviation. In this context,
                        hydrogen needs to be low carbon from the outset and ultimately green (produced by electrolysis
                        of water using renewable electricity).

                        </br>
                        In this chapter, we study the electrolysis process, the type of electrolysers used to produce hydrogen,
                        we study hydrogen production costs, and the connection between hydrogen and renewables.

                        H2O and O2 are <strong>diatomic elements</strong>: always form groups of two. You will never find just one alone.
                        Other diatomic elements: B2, I2, N2, Cl2, H2, O2, F2.

                        The balance equation represents an <strong>oxidation reduction process</strong>: Electrons are transferred to form new elements.

                        How do the <strong>electrons move</strong> during the reduction process? To understand that process,
                        it is useful to write the <strong>oxidation numbers</strong>:

                                        In the balance equation, the oxygen has a negative charge. Therefore, to become neutral, it needs to <strong>lose two electrons</strong>.

            <h2>Electrolyser: Technology characterisation</h2>
            <br>
                Water electrolysers are electrochemical devices
                used to split water molecules into hydrogen and
                oxygen by passage of an electrical current. They
                can be fragmented in <strong>three levels</strong> (figure: Electrolyser components)</strong>:
                </br>
                </br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The<strong> cell</strong> is the core of the electrolyser and it
                        is where the electrochemical process takes
                        place. It is composed of the two electrodes
                        (anode and cathode) immersed in a liquid
                        electrolyte or adjacent to a solid electrolyte
                        membrane, two porous transport layers
                        (which facilitate the transport of reactants
                        and removal of products), and the bipolar
                        plates that provide mechanical support and
                        distribute the flow.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The <strong>stack</strong> has a broader scope, which includes
                        multiple cells connected in series, spacers
                        (insulating material between two opposite
                        electrodes), seals, frames (mechanical
                        support) and end plates (to avoid leaks and
                        collect fluids).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The <strong>system level</strong> (or balance of plant) goes
                        beyond the stack to include equipment
                        for cooling, processing the hydrogen (e.g.
                        for purity and compression), converting
                        the electricity input (e.g. transformer and
                        rectifier), treating the water supply (e.g.
                        deionization) and gas output (e.g. of
                        oxygen).
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </br>
                Purified water is fed into the system using
                circulating pumps, or also by gravity. The water
                then reaches the electrodes by flowing through the
                bipolar plates and through the porous transport
                layers. At the electrode, the water is split into
                oxygen and hydrogen, with ions (typically H+ or
                OH-) crossing though a liquid or solid membrane
                electrolyte. The membrane or diaphragm between
                both electrodes is also responsible for keeping the
                produced gases (hydrogen and oxygen) separated
                and avoiding their mixture. This general principle
                has remained the same for centuries, but the
                technology has evolved since William Nicholson
                and Anthony Carlisle first developed it in 1800.
                </br>
                </br>
                The principle of water electrolysis is simple, yet it
                allows the construction of different technological
                variations based on various physicalchemical
                and electrochemical aspects. <strong>Electrolysers are
                    typically divided into four main technologies</strong> (figure: Electrolyser types).
                These are distinguished based on the <strong>electrolyte</strong>
                and <strong>temperature of operation</strong>, which in turn will
                guide the selection of different materials and
                components.

                        These have a simple stack
                        and system design and are relatively easy to
                        manufacture. Currently, they have electrode areas
                        as high as 3 square metres (m²). They operate
                        with high concentrate KOH (typically 57 moles of
                        solute per litre of solution [mol*L-1]) as electrolyte,
                        robust ZrO2 based diaphragms and nickel (Ni)
                        coated stainless-steel for the electrodes. The
                        ionic charge carrier is the hydroxyl ion OH-, with
                        KOH and water permeating through the porous
                        structure of the diaphragm to provide functionality
                        for the electrochemical reaction. This allows the
                        intermixing of the produced gases (hydrogen
                        and oxygen – H2 and O2) that are dissolved in the
                        electrolyte, limiting lower power-operating range
                        and the ability to operate at higher pressure levels.

                                cheap nickel electrodes; electricity demand
                                decreases and part of the energy for separation
                                is provided through heat (waste heat can be used
                                and apparent efficiencies based on electricity can
                                be higher than 100%); the potential for reversibility
                                (operating as fuel cell and electrolyser); coelectrolysis
                                of CO2 and water to produce syngas
                                (which is the basic building block for the chemical
                                industry).

                                On the downside, thermo-chemical
                                cycling, especially under shutdown/ramping
                                periods, leads to faster degradation and shorter
                                lifetimes. Other issues related to stack degradation
                                include: challenges related to sealing at higher
                                differential pressure; electrode contamination
                                by silica used as sealants; and other additional
                                contaminant sources from piping, interconnects
                                and sealing. SOECs are today only deployed at the
                                kW-scale, although some current demonstration
                                projects have already reached 1 MW.

                                latest technology with only a few companies

                                potential lies in the combination of a less harsh
                                environment from alkaline electrolysers with the
                                simplicity and efficiency of a PEM electrolyser.

                                allows the use of non-noble catalysts, titanium-free
                                components, and, as with PEM, operation under
                                differential pressure.

                                The reality, however, is that
                                the AEM membrane has chemical and mechanical
                                stability problems, leading to unstable lifetime
                                profiles.

                            <li>
                                Moreover, performance is not yet as good as expected, mostly due to low AEM conductivity,
                                poor electrode architectures and slow catalyst
                                kinetics.

                                Performance enhancement is typically
                                achieved by tuning membrane conductivity
                                properties, or by adding a supporting electrolyte
                                (e.g. KOH, or sodium bicarbonate [NaHCO3]).

                                tuning could lead to decreased durability, however.
                                The OH- ion is intrinsically three-fold slower (lower
                                conductivity) than H+ protons within PEM, which
                                forces AEM developers to either make thinner
                                membranes, or ones with higher charge density.

            The components of an electrolyser are represented in figure: Electrolyser components.

                        Hydrogen processing unit: Compression.
                        </br>
                        </br>
                        Hydrogen from the electrolyser is in gaseous
                        form, conventionally from atmospheric pressure
                        to 30 bar, while higher pressures are possible. To
                        facilitate hydrogen transport, a lower volume is
                        needed. This means either increasing the pressure,
                        liquefying the gas, or converting it for liquid organic
                        hydrogen carriers. Compression can make a large difference. Going from atmospheric to 70 bar (a
                        typical pressure for transmission pipelines) can
                        already reduce the gas volume by a factor of 65.
                        Compressing it to 1 000 bar (a typical pressure for
                        storage in tanks) can reduce the volume by a factor
                        of 625 compared to atmospheric, and liquefaction
                        by a factor of 870.

                        Water and land use for green hydrogen production

                        </br>
                        <strong>Water use</strong> is not barrier to scaling up
                        electrolysis. Even in places with water
                        stress, sea water desalination can be
                        used with limited penalties on cost or
                        efficiency.
                        </br>
                        </br>
                        For the <strong>land area</strong>, there are no real projects of more
                        than 100 MW in water electrolysis (the largest one,
                        as of November 2020, is 20 MW, in Becancour,
                        Canada). Thus, so far, land area estimates rely
                        on engineering estimates, rather than plot
                        optimisation based on real experience. Yet, there
                        are a couple of estimates available:

                                in 2014 estimated that a 100 MW electrolyser
                                plant would occupy about 6 300 m2.

                                Siemens estimated back in 2017 that a

                                about 180 metres (m) x 80 m (15 000 m2).

                                40 m x 87 m (3 500 m2), with the possibility
                                of using multiple layout options to fit different
                                applications and of replicating this easily by
                                having a standardised design.

                                (composed of five modules of 20 MW each)
                                with a plot size of 4 500 m2.

                        </br>
                        To put these numbers in perspective, a global
                        capacity of 1 000 GW of electrolysers, which would
                        be enough to replace the entire current pure and
                        mixed hydrogen fossil-based production, would
                        occupy a land area of the size of Manhattan, New
                        York, using the most conservative estimate (i.e.
                        0.17 km2).

                        </br>
                        Another reference is that this energy
                        density of almost 7 500 MW/km2 is almost 1 500
                        times larger than a relatively good onshore wind
                        density of 5 MW/km2,
                        which means the electrolyser would only be a
                        fraction of the space occupied by the renewable
                        electricity input, highlighting the need to use
                        hydrogen only for applications that are hard to
                        electrify and reduce the upstream renewable
                        capacity needed to satisfy the same demand.

            <h3>Trade-offs to consider in the design of the electrolyser</h3>
            <p>
                On the supply side, the prospects for green hydrogen
                depend on the <strong>performance of the electrolyser</strong>.
                The key dimensions that $R\&D$ strategies need to
                address are:
                </br>
                </br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The<strong> efficiency</strong> increase at the cell, stack, and
	                    system level (this reduces operational cost).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The <strong>current to the stack</strong> is directly related
                        to cell and stack capacity and therefore to
                        hydrogen production.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A <strong>durability</strong> increase to more than 100 000
                        hours for any developed system concept.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        An <strong>investment cost</strong> reduction (both stack
	                    and system).
                    </li>
                </ul>

                        These four dimensions are related to each other,
                        however, and improvement in one of them usually
                        leads to a poorer performance in another.
                        </br>
                        </br>
                        <u>For example</u>, a thicker membrane is mechanically
                        stronger and leads to longer lifetime profiles, but it also increases the resistance to the transport of
                        charges, which in turn decreases the efficiency.
                        While the longer lifetime results in a lower cost
                        contribution of the investment component, the
                        lower efficiency results in a higher operating cost
                        given the higher electricity consumption. Figure: Trade-offs: Efficiency, durability and costs shows the positive or negative effect (arrows +
                        colour) some of the independent choices during
                        manufacturing and research (green boxes) can
                        have on each dimension.

                        </br>
                        Another <strong>two important
                        aspects </strong>are the use of <strong>more active catalysts</strong> and the <strong>specific business case for the electrolyser</strong>.

                        </br>
                        The use of more <strong>active catalysts</strong> that
                        are able to improve efficiency levels, but could
                        have negative impact on durability. One example
                        is ruthenium catalysts, which are more active
                        than iridium, but suffer from long-term stability.
                        Moreover, any catalyst free of critical raw materials
                        needs to be aimed at higher efficiencies, but this
                        typically result in catalysts that are less robust and
                        more prone to dissolution.

            <p>
                The <strong>specific business case for the electrolyser</strong> will
                also affect the optimisation of these parameters.
                For example, an electrolyser that is coupled with
                PV could only operate typically less than 2 000
                hours in a year, making the capital cost a critical
                parameter to tackle. With such limited operating
                hours, durability might be less of an issue, since a
                short operating lifetime still translates into a longer
                actual lifetime. This could lead to using materials
                that are cheaper, but degrade faster. This case is
                different to one where the electrolyser is coupled
                with a concentrated solar power that has higher
                operating hours in a year, but that delivers a higher
                electricity price, making efficiency more important
                to reduce the operational cost.

            <p>
                The lifetime of electrolyser technologies is a function of the cumulative current
                passing through the stack, which can be represented
                by the <strong>number of full load hours</strong> as well as the
                <strong>number of operating hours</strong> – the number of hours
                during which the facility is on, regardless of load
                operating levels.

                        operating conditions (i.e. not coupled to variable

                        The main degradation

                        case of dynamic operation.

                        Reversible operation
                        of solid oxide cells (electrolysis + fuel cell) could
                        help increase the hours of operation and thus keep
                        the system at operating temperature.
                        </br>
                        </br>
                        Deploying
                        SOEC at large scale would require larger cells
                        than currently used (up from 300 cm2 to more
                        than 1 000 cm2), which renders them more prone
                        to failure.

                      AEM electrolysers suffer from a short lifetime,
                        while limited information about their long-term

                        </br>
                        </br>
                        The stability of the AEM polymer used to fabricate
                        membrane and catalyst layers is well recognised
                        as a major issue, especially when operated with
                        KOH as the supporting electrolyte.

                        The main
                        degradation mechanism is hydroxide (OH-)
                        attack on the polymer backbone, which leads to
                        membrane collapse and catalyst layer dissolution
                        within a few days.

                        One solution is cross-linking
                        chemical methods, but this comes at a cost of cell
                        efficiency. Another approach is by operating the
                        stack without a supporting electrolyte (i.e. using
                        only pure water), which can lead to a durability
                        beyond 5 000 hours, but this results in much lower
                        efficiencies, or current densities.

                hours consumed per kilograms of hydrogen

                        The efficiency profile decreases linearly

                        In addition to regulations and market design, the cost of production is a major barrier to the uptake of green hydrogen.
                        Costs are falling – largely due to falling renewable power costs – but green hydrogen is still 2-3 
                        times more expensive than blue hydrogen (produced from fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage) 
                        and further cost reductions are needed.
                        </br>
                        </br>
                        <strong>The largest single cost component for on-site production of green hydrogen is the cost of the renewable electricity</strong>
                        needed to power the electrolyser unit. This renders production of green hydrogen more expensive 
                        than blue hydrogen, regardless of the cost of the electrolyser. 
                        <strong>A low cost of electricity is therefore a necessary condition for producing competitive green hydrogen</strong>.
                        This creates an opportunity to produce hydrogen at locations around the world that have optimal renewable 
                        resources, in order to achieve competitiveness.

                        </br>
                        Low electricity cost is not enough by itself for competitive green hydrogen production, however, 
                        and<strong> reductions in the cost of electrolysis facilities are also needed</strong>. This is the
                        second largest cost component of green hydrogen production and is the focus of this report, 
                        which identifies key strategies to <strong>reduce investment costs for electrolysis plants from 40%
                        in the short term to 80% in the long term</strong>. These strategies range from the fundamental design
                        of the electrolyser stack to broader system-wide elements, including:

                      Increased module size and innovation with increased stack manufacturing have significant impacts on
                      cost. Increasing the plant from 1 MW (typical today) to 20 MW could reduce costs by over a third.
                      Cost, however, is not the only factor influencing plant size, as each technology has its own
                      stack design, which also varies between manufacturers. The optimal system design also depends
                      on the application that drives system performance in aspects such as efficiency and flexibility.

                      Increasing stack production to automated production in GW- scale manufacturing facilities can achieve
                      a step-change cost reduction. At lower manufacture rates, the stack is about 45% of the total cost,
                      yet at higher production rates, it can go down to 30%. For Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM)
                      electrolysers, the tipping point seems to be around 1 000 units (of 1 MW) per year, where this scale-up
                      allows an almost 50% cost reduction in stack manufacturing. The cost of the surrounding plant is as
                      important as the electrolyser stack and savings can be achieved through standardisation of system
                      components and plant design.

                  <p class="text-right">
                      Scarce materials can represent a barrier to electrolyser cost and scale-up. Current production of
                      iridium and platinum for PEM electrolysers will only support an estimated 3 GW-7.5 GW annual
                      manufacturing capacity, compared to an estimated annual manufacturing requirement of around 100
                      GW by 2030. Solutions that avoid the use of such materials are already being implemented by leading
                      alkaline electrolyser manufacturers, and technologies exist to significantly reduce the requirements
                      for such materials in PEM electrolysers. Anion Exchange Membrane (AEM) electrolysers do not need
                      scarce materials in the first place.

                  <p class="text-right">
                      Power supply represents large efficiency losses at low load, limiting system flexibility from an
                      economic perspective. A modular plant design with multiple stacks and power supply units can address
                      this problem. Compression could also represent a bottleneck for flexibility, since it might not be
                      able to change its production rate as quickly as the stack.
                      </br>
                      </br>
                      One alternative to deal with this is an integrated plant design with enough capacity to deal with
                      variability of production through optimised and integrated electricity and hydrogen storage. Green
                      hydrogen production can provide significant flexibility for the power system, if the value of such
                      services is recognised and remunerated adequately. Where hydrogen will play a key role in terms of
                      flexibility, as it does not have any significant alternative sources to compete with, will be in the
                      <strong> seasonal storage of renewables</strong>. Although this comes at significant efficiency losses, it
                      is a necessary cornerstone for achieving 100% renewable generation in power systems with heavy
                      reliance on variable resources, such as solar and wind.

                        Figure: Hydrogen cost reduction trends illustrates the potential green hydrogen production cost reduction between
                        2020 and 2050 for a range of electrolysers cost and deployment levels. In the best-case scenario,
                        green hydrogen can already be produced at costs competitive with blue hydrogen today, using <strong>low cost
                        renewable electricity</strong>, i.e. around USD 20 per megawatt-hour (MWh).
                        </br>
                        </br>
                        A low electricity price is essential for the production of competitive green hydrogen, and, as illustrated in
                        figure: Hydrogen cost reduction trends, cost reductions in electrolysers cannot compensate for high electricity prices.
                        Combined with low electricity cost, an aggressive electrolyser deployment pathway can make green hydrogen
                        cheaper than any low-carbon alternative (i.e. < USD 1/kg), before 2040. If rapid scale-up takes place
                        in the next decade, green hydrogen is expected to start becoming competitive with blue hydrogen by
                        2030 in a wide range of countries – e.g. those with electricity prices of USD 30/MWh – and in applications.

                        </br>
                        Today’s cost and performance are not the same for all electrolyser technologies.
                        Alkaline and PEM electrolysers are the most advanced and already commercial, while each technology has its own competitive
                        advantage. Alkaline electrolysers have the lowest installed cost, while PEM electrolysers have a much smaller
                        footprint, combined with higher current density and output pressure. Meanwhile, solid oxide has the highest
                        electrical efficiency.

            </div>

            <p>
                As the cell stack is only part of the electrolyser facility footprint, a reduced stack footprint of
                around 60% for PEM compared to alkaline translates into a 20%-24% reduction in the facility footprint, with an estimated
                footprint of 8 hectares (ha)-13 ha for a 1 GW facility
                using PEM, compared to 10 ha-17 ha using alkaline. <strong>Gaps in cost and performance are expected to narrow over time as innovation
                and mass deployment of different electrolysis
                technologies drive convergence towards similar
                costs</strong>.
                </br>
                </br>
                The wide range in system costs is expected
                to remain, however, as this is very much dependent
                on the scale, application and scope of delivery. For
                instance, a containerised system inside an existing
                facility with existing power supply is significantly
                lower cost than a new building in a plot of land to
                be purchased, with complete water and electricity
                supply system to be included, high purity hydrogen for fuel cell applications and high output
                pressure. Normally, numbers for system costs
                include not only cell stack, but also balance of
                stacks, power rectifiers, the hydrogen purification
                system, water supply and purification, cooling and
                commissioning – yet exclude shipping, civil works
                and site preparations.

            <h2>Hydrogen and renewables</h2>
            <p>
                Hydrogen is only one option in <strong>decarbonising
                hard-to-abate sectors</strong>. Energy efficiency is key
                to reducing the energy supply and renewable
                capacity upstream, while <strong>bioenergy</strong> might be
                suitable, not only in the form of biofuels for those
                transport sectors that have limited fuel alternatives
                (especially aviation), but also as a source of carbon
                for synthetic fuels. Direct electrification is more
                efficient from a systems perspective, leading
                to lower cost, with this already commercially
                deployed in many areas (e.g. heating or passenger
                vehicles). <strong>Carbon capture and storage (CCS)</strong> might
                be attractive for existing assets that are still in
                early stages of their lifetime (the case for many
                assets in Asia) and process emissions (e.g. from
                cement production). Even for the most ambitious
                scenarios, these technological choices might not
                be enough, however, and behavioural changes
                might be needed to push energy demand even
                lower. Thus, for energy transition, hydrogen is one
                solution amongst others and should be tackled in
                parallel. Hydrogen is part of a wider technology
                portfolio to be adapted to domestic conditions in
                each country, with this report further exploring this
                pathway.
                </br>
                </br>
                Hydrogen can be used in different directions, and could play a crucial role decarbonizing different sectors:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Once produced at scale and competitive cost,
                        green hydrogen can also be further <strong>converted
                        into other energy carriers</strong>, such as ammonia,
                        methanol, methane and liquid hydrocarbons. As
                        a fuel, hydrogen can be used in fuel cells (i.e. an
                        electrochemical device that combines hydrogen
                        with oxygen from the air and produces electricity),
                        but also combusted in engines and turbines.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Fuel cells</strong> can be used for stationary applications in
                        large-scale power plants, microgrid or backup
                        generation (e.g. in data centres), or for a wide range
                        of transport applications – as is already done in
                        fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEV), trucks, light-duty
                        vehicles, forklifts, buses, ferries and ships.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        As a <strong>chemical</strong>, green hydrogen can reduce greenhouse
                        gas (GHG) emissions from sectors where hydrogen
                        from fossil fuel is widely used today, including oil
                        refining, methanol and ammonia production.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <strong>Green hydrogen</strong> is only one of the production
                pathways. Hydrogen can also be produced from
                <strong>bioenergy, methane, coal or even directly from
                solar energy</strong>. Most of the production today is
                based on methane and coal (about 95%) (IRENA,
                2019) and could be made low carbon with the
                use of CCS. CCS might be suitable for regions with
                low-cost natural gas and suitable underground
                reservoirs. In the short term, CCS might also be
                a good fit for large-scale applications in industry,
                given the relatively small scale of deployment for
                electrolysis.

            <h2>Flexibility of green hydrogen production facilities</h2>
            <h3>Factors that determine hydrogen flexibility</h3>
            <p>
                To ensure that green hydrogen supply cost is as
                low as possible, a holistic approach needs to be
                applied to system design and operations. System
                design can be optimised to <strong>minimise cost</strong> and
                <strong>increase flexibility</strong> as necessary, depending on a
                variety of factors. These can include:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        The variability
                        of electricity supply (i.e. constant consumption of
                        grid electricity, or direct feed from variable solar
                        or wind farms).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The technology used for the stack
                        (e.g. alkaline, PEM and AEM being more flexible
                        than solid oxide).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The flexibility of hydrogen
                        demand (e.g. constant demand for chemical
                        processes, general annual demand for export
                        without hourly or daily constraints).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Storage can
                        significantly help to decouple variable supply from
                        hydrogen demand. This can come in the form of electrochemical storage for short-term fluctuations
                        (before the electrolyser stack), or in the form
                        of hydrogen storage for long-term fluctuations
                        (after the stack, before the downstream off-taker).
                        Similarly, hydrogen storage in tanks, caverns and
                        pipelines can help decouple variable hydrogen
                        production from inflexible hydrogen demand
                        (e.g. to produce ammonia).
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <h3>Long duration storage</h3>
            <div class="text_image_css">
                <div>
                    <p>
                        Where hydrogen has a significant role to play in
                        terms of <strong>flexibility provision</strong> in future decarbonised
                        power systems is in <strong>long duration storage and
                        system adequacy</strong>. The seasonality of solar, wind
                        and hydropower resources can provide challenges
                        in terms of adequacy – if not every year, at least in
                        unusual weather years (e.g. dry years, or years with
                        extended periods of low wind). Hydrogen from
                        renewable power can be stored cost effectively
                        – for example, in salt caverns – and can be used
                        for power generation in these particular periods.
                        </br>
                        </br>
                        Due to the near zero short run marginal cost
                        of solar and wind, when they are reach significant
                        generation share in a market interval (e.g. in a
                        one hour period), they drive down electricity prices.
                        Figure: Hydrogen seasonality shows how hydrogen production follows
                        renewable
                        electricity
                        availability,
                        highlighting
                        an important seasonality in the production of
                        hydrogen.
                        </br>
                        </br>
                        The key message is that hydrogen production from
                        electrolysers can be uniquely positioned to provide
                        seasonal flexibility to the power system – something that no other resource can effectively provide.
                        This can play a significant role in balancing a
                        power system with high shares of solar and
                        wind, not only instantaneously and intra-day,
                        but also across seasons. To be able to provide
                        such services, electrolysers must be designed
                        not to operate at full capacity the entire year,
                        but rather to purchase electricity when green
                        and affordable. This is only possible if they are
                        sufficiently oversized to avoid purchasing non
                        renewable
                        electricity, or prohibitively expensive
                        electricity, just to be able to meet hydrogen
                        demand.

            <h3>Flexibility services</h3>
            <p>
                Hydrogen can be <strong>stored</strong> and <strong>transported</strong> in multiple
                ways. In terms of <strong>flexibility services</strong>, electrolysers
                have been evaluated in terms of:

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        The time they take to respond to a change in power set-point.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The time they take to settle after a power set-point change.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The rate at which they can change power consumption.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The lower operation limit, or the minimum turn down level.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The time they take to start up and shut down.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                A <strong>report</strong> (Eichman, Harrison and Peters, 2014) has found that:

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Small electrolyser systems (around 40 kW
                        units) begin changing their electricity
                        demand within milliseconds of a set-point
                        change.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The settling time after a set-point change is in the order of seconds.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Electrolysers can reduce their electrical consumption to zero for an unlimited amount of time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Electrolysers exhibit low part load operation capabilities.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Electrolysers can start up and shut down in several minutes.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <h3>Short-term flexibility</h3>
            <p>
                From the point of view of <strong>short-term flexibility</strong>
                alkaline and PEM water electrolysers still present the
                most interesting technical capability, as they have proven to provide very fast dynamics among all
                available electrolysis process.
            </p>

            <h3>Hydrogen and congestion management</h3>
            <p>
                For
                <strong>congestion
                    management</strong>,
                large
                scale
                electrolysers can contribute to the reduction of
                critical peak loads by reducing their electricity
                demand, or even by completely interrupting
                operation. This service should be remunerated
                adequately, however, to compensate for the
                economic incentive to operate the electrolyser as
                many hours as possible to reduce the contribution
                of the investment cost to the total cost. Moreover,
                such an application can also have its limitations,
                since several industrial processes cannot be
                stopped when integrated with the electrolyser
                facility, therefore limiting flexibility of operations
                based on the size of the hydrogen storage.
