            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <p>
                IRENA estimates that the number
                of jobs in the renewable energy sector could increase
                from 10.3 million in 2017 to nearly
                29 million in 2050. The sector offers
                diverse opportunities along the
                value chain, requiring different skill
                sets and talents.
                </br>
                </br>
                In that context, increased
                women’s engagement expands the
                <strong>talent pool</strong> for the renewables sector.
                Meanwhile, greater gender diversity
                also brings substantial co-benefits.
                Studies suggest that women bring
                <strong>new perspectives to the workplace</strong>
                and <strong>improve collaboration</strong>, while
                increasing the number of qualified
                women in an organisation’s leadership
                yields <strong>better performance overall</strong>.
                In the context of energy access, engaging
                women as active agents in
                deploying off-grid renewable energy
                solutions is known to improve
                sustainability and gender outcomes.
                </br>
                </br>
                The document "Renewable Energy: A
                Gender Perspective" (2019) aims to address
                this knowledge gap. It analyses the
                status of women’s participation in
                the sector in two distinct deployment
                settings – <strong>the modern context</strong> (in
                which renewables displace or complement
                conventional energy) and
                <strong>the energy access</strong> context (which is
                characterised by efforts to expand
                access to modern energy services).

            <h2>Women in renewable energy: Modern energy context</h2>

            <h3>Status and trends</h3>
            
            <p>
                While it is true that renewable energy
                is subject to some of the same
                limitations and barriers that prevail in
                the energy sector at large, this report
                shows that <strong>women already have
                    a stronger presence in renewable
                    energy than is the case in fossil fuels</strong>.
                Furthermore,
                renewable
                energy
                offers a range of unprecedented
                opportunities. As a young and dynamic sector, it is open to change in ways that are harder to effect in
                an industry as set in its ways as the
                the relatively mature fossil fuel sector.
                In the unfolding energy transition,
                women will have the chance to garner
                a growing share of employment.
                </br>
                </br>
                A better gender balance is not a
                zero-sum game in which women
                stand to gain while men lose. Studies
                have shown that an increase in the
                number of qualified women in an
                organisation’s leadership yields <strong>better
                    performance overall</strong> (Noland et al.,
                2016). Women are also likely to bring
                <strong>new perspectives</strong> into their work, are
                more likely to <strong>act collaboratively</strong> in
                the workplace and may contribute
                to <strong>greater fairness</strong> (Moodley et al.,
                2016). A better gender balance in
                male-dominated
                professions
                has
                been shown to contribute to the <strong>improvement of working conditions</strong>
                for both men and women, with
                positive effects on <strong>well-being</strong>, <strong>work
                    culture and productivity</strong> (WISE, 2017).

                    Available information strongly
                    indicates that employment in the
                    conventional energy industry is male
                    dominated:

                        Petroleum Council and Boston
                        Consulting Group put <strong>the share of
                            women in the worldwide oil and
                            gas workforce at 22% </strong>– much lower
                        than in manufacturing, finance,
                        education, health and social work,

                        oil-and-gas sector that require a
                        college degree and <strong>25% of midcareer-level jobs</strong>, their share is only
                        <strong>17% in senior and executive roles</strong>.
                        <strong>Only one in a hundred CEOs in the

                        management roles, roughly half the
                        share in the educational and social

                of the workforce in the
                renewable energy sector</h4>

                    Studies to date confirm that women
                    are also under-represented in the
                    renewable energy sector. Reports
                    from countries such as Canada,
                    Germany, Italy, Spain and the United
                    States  suggest that
                    typically less than 30% of jobs in
                    the <strong>renewable energy sector</strong> are held by women (Figure: Share of female full-time workforce in renewable energy and
		            oil and gas). Women are more
                    likely to be employed in lower
                    paid,
                    non-technical,
                    administrative
                    and public relations positions than
                    in technical, managerial or policy
                    making
                    positions. This
                    contrasts sharply with the fact that
                    <strong>women represent more than 50% of
                        university students</strong>, and<strong> almost half
                        the labour force in these countries</strong>.

            <h3>Barriers to entry</h3>
            <p>
                Almost two-thirds of all
                respondents think that women face some barriers to access to renewable energy works. However,
                this result is strongly driven by
                female respondents, three quarters
                of whom answered in the affirmative.
                By contrast, only 40% of male survey
                participants agreed (Figure: Shares of women and men who perceive that women face barriers).

                            STEM (Science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects (UNESCO, 2017). Girls
                            are often brought up to believe that
                            STEM subjects are “masculine” topics
                            and that women’s ability is innately

                            imbalance in these fields, only 12%
                            of engineers in the United Kingdom
                            are women, compared with 47% of
                            the overall workforce. Between 2015
                            and 2016, just 16% of those who

                            16–19 said in a survey they would
                            ever consider a career in engineering. Similar

                        respectively; for vice presidents, it was
                        30%, but for senior vice presidents and

                        IRENA’s survey provides evidence
                        for different types of organisations
                        working in the renewable energy
                        sector. Survey responses indicate that
                        men account for a majority of board
                        members at 65% of participating
                        private sector firms. In close to half
                        of all firms, men represent at least three-quarters of directors. The
                        distribution is also heavily male biased
                        among national agencies and intergovernmental
                        organisations in the
                        sample, although almost a quarter
                        of them have equal representation
                        between the genders. In comparison,
                        non-governmental organisations have
                        a much better gender balance (Figure: Gender composition of board of directors in the renewable energy sector).

                        key barriers women face, given that,
                        in many societies, they are expected
                        not only to excel at work but also to
                        reliably perform many tasks outside

                        other care-giving responsibilities and
                        various household chores. “Having it
                        all” is especially difficult when there is
                        little flexibility at work.

                        <strong>An added burden is found in mobility
                            requirements</strong>, particularly among
                        those in the renewable energy
                        sector who hold field jobs (project
                        planners, installers, operators) and
                        may thus be subject to frequent travel
                        requirements, relocation and long
                        periods of time away from home and
                        family. While this can be challenging
                        for men and women alike, women
                        with care-giving responsibilities,
                        especially for young children, face a
                        particular disadvantage.

                        </br>
                        However, one must not assume that
                        women would prefer not to hold
                        such jobs. Many women already work
                        in less-than-optimal environments,
                        and for much less pay than they
                        could make in renewables. Given
                        the
                        option,
                        some
                        women
                        may
                        prefer work in renewable energy
                        simply
                        because
                        of
                        the
                        potential
                        to earn higher wages. Because of
                        persistent male-biased norms (often
                        unintended or unconscious), even
                        women who are able and willing to
                        work may not be given the option
                        to
                        choose
                        between

                        low pay and similar conditions with
                        higher pay. Instead, women are
                        tracked into feminised occupations in
                        administrative and support services
                        within the sector.

                        OECD countries reveals that although

                        Close to two-thirds of IRENA survey

                        renewable energy earn less than men
                        for the same position, while one-third
                        believe they earn the same, and just
                        1% believe women are paid more
                        (Figure: Beliefs about pay equity among men and women). But the survey also indicates
                        that
                        perceptions
                        about
                        wage equity are strongly shaped
                        by a gender bias. Among male
                        respondents, just 37% say they think
                        men are paid more, as opposed to
                        70% of female respondents. Some
                        60% of men have the perception that
                        both genders are paid equally.

            <p>
                To promote gender equality in
                renewable energy employment, it is
                important to assess whether gender
                perspectives enter into decision
                making.
                Gender audits can help
                answer this question in the context
                of public policy
                measures such as
                legislation and regulations, and in the
                private sector.

                    A <strong>gender audit</strong> is one aspect of what
                is referred to as “mainstreaming”:
                analysing
                legislation,
                regulations,
                taxation and specific projects for
                their effect on the status of women
                in society. <strong>The basic
                    assumption

                    men in the family and their status in
                    the economy</strong>. They are essential for

                    <u>The Pink to Green Toolkit: Wider Opportunities for Women.</u>
			        </br>
                    </br>
                    Wider Opportunities for Women advocates for gender equity in employment in the United States. Its
                    Pink to Green Toolkit includes<strong> presentations</strong>, <strong>trainings</strong>, <strong>webinars</strong>, <strong>curriculum guides and modules</strong>, <strong>briefs</strong>,
                    <strong>templates</strong>, <strong>tip sheets</strong>, and planning documents designed to maximise capacity building in recruiting,
                    assessing, placing and retaining women in green occupations.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    The toolkit is organised into <strong>five categories</strong>: outreach and recruitment of women, assessment and case
                    management for women, building critical skills of job readiness, gender-inclusive and gender-focused
                    training design, and sexual harassment.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    The<strong> resources</strong> in the toolkit include a myths-and-facts worksheet
                    about common stereotypes, presentations about the benefits of green jobs for women, an assessment
                    of a company’s or organisation’s capacity to serve and recruit women, a tip sheet to plan a career fair,
                    a module on building skill and confidence of women to perform well in interviews, modules addressing
                    communication and learning styles of women, and many more.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    The toolkit can be a valuable resource for organisations working on equity in renewable energy and the
                    broader green economy in other countries.

                their accomplishments not only
                recognises their trail-blazing work, but also highlights opportunities for
                women joining the renewable energy

                      Understanding and addressing <strong>wage

                    perception of inequities. To some
                    extent, wage differentials reflect the general gender bias in the workforce

                    positions. However, there is also
                    a need to ensure that <strong>equal work

                    The survey shows that 63% of all
                    organisations participating in the
                    survey offer part-time work and
                    survey participants indicated that
                    this can be important in reducing
                    gender barriers. Availability varies.
                    While NGOs score highest at 84%,
                    only 40% of governments and IGOs
                    allow part-time work (or similar
                    measures such as working from home and flexi-time). Private sector
                    companies

                    of 62%. Survey results confirm that
                    the availability of part-time slightly
                    increases the share of women in
                    the workforce. Compared with their
                    32% share of full-time employment,
                    women account for 36% of part-time
                    workers. However, part-time work offers less work and social benefits (Figure: Comparison of benefits among full- and part-time employees).

                <strong>Adequate paid

                    limited to women; <strong>paternal leave can
                        help parents </strong>share the burden of child
                    rearing. But, such policies need to be
                    coupled with public policy measures
                    or corporate undertakings to allow
                    women (and men) to resume the
                    positions they held previously without
                    sidelining their career prospects. In

                    practices may in many cases merely
                    reflect local legal requirements. As of
                    2014, a total of 83 countries offer paid
                    maternity leave of up to 14 weeks;
                    another 53 provide 14-25 weeks, 18
                    offer 26-51 weeks, while 36 offer 52
                    weeks or more (Figure: Paid maternal leave, in weeks). Some
                    70 countries worldwide also offer
                    paid paternity leave.

                    By sharp contrast, the United States is
                    one of just nine countries worldwide
                    that have no legal requirement of paid
                    maternity leave at all. In those countries, private
                    executives decide how hospitable

                    <strong>Part-time work</strong> is usually defined as a specific number of work hours that make up less than a full work
                    week, but the threshold varies among countries. The specific distribution of work hours across a week,
                    month or year can vary strongly. The share of part-time workers in overall employment has generally
                    increased in developed countries but remains low in most developing countries. <strong>Women are believed
                        to represent close to 60% of all part-time workers, a much higher portion than their share of the total
                        workforce</strong>.

                    </br>
                    <strong>Flexi-time (also called flex-time)</strong> is a system in which people work a set number of hours within a given
                    period, but the starting and finishing times are chosen by the employee within agreed limits (e.g., core
                    working hours are not subject to flexi-time arrangements). Pay and benefits should in principle be
                    unaffected, since there is no net reduction of working hours.

                    <strong>Job sharing</strong> is an arrangement under which two people voluntarily share the responsibilities of one
                    full time job. The individuals involved work as a team to complete a given task and share responsibility
                    for the overall workload. Job sharing may involve people working half days, alternate days or alternate
                    weeks. Total working hours are typically divided equally among job sharers, who receive salary and
                    benefits on pro-rata basis.

            <h2>Women in renewable energy: Access context</h2>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>
                Globally, the number of <strong>people without
                    access to electricity fell below 1 billion</strong>
                for the first time in 2016. The number
                without
                access
                to
                clean
                cooking
                facilities has been gradually declining,
                but still accounted for nearly 3 billion
                globally in 2016 (World Bank, 2018).
                </br>
                </br>
                The
                lack
                of
                access
                to
                modern
                energy <strong>affects women and children
                    disproportionately</strong>. A large amount
                of their time and labour is spent
                on unpaid care work, subsistence
                and productive tasks (e.g., <strong>gathering
                    fuelwood for cooking, fetching water,
                    manually processing grain or other
                    food</strong>) (World Bank, 2017).

                    <strong>Indoor air pollution</strong> resulting from the
                    use of traditional fuels for cooking
                    and limitations on the delivery of
                    healthcare, education, water and
                    other basic public services owing to
                    the lack of modern energy also has
                    a far greater impact on women and
                    children than on men.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    Access to affordable, reliable and
                    sustainable modern energy can have a
                    transformative <strong>impact on productivity,
                        incomes and overall well-being</strong>. It
                    frees up time for women collecting
                    fuelwood and enables time-shifting of
                    tasks with access to lighting, opening
                    new opportunities for leisure, part
                    time
                    work and income-generating
                    activities. There are also strong cross
                    cutting
                    links to other sectors, including
                    improved
                    education
                    opportunities
                    for girls, safety, and access to media.

                    <h3>Barriers and challenges</h3>
                    
                    Over <strong>two-thirds (66%) of survey
                        respondents</strong> stated their belief that
                    women working or seeking work in
                    expanding access through renewable
                    energy faced <strong>barriers</strong>.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    The barriers were associated with
                    several factors. Cultural and social
                    norms were cited by respondents as
                    the most common barrier to women’s
                    participation in the access sector, followed by lack of gender-sensitive
                    policies and training opportunities
                    and inequity in ownership of assets
                    (Figure: Barriers to women’s participation in deploying renewables to expand energy access). Security and the
                    remoteness of field locations were
                    also mentioned as other barriers to
                    women’s participation.

                        The gender division of
                        labour results in women allotting
                        a significant amount of their time
                        to<strong> household work and childcare
                        (and elderly care)</strong> responsibilities,
                        and consequently having <strong>limited
                        skills and time to engage in formal,
                        paid activities</strong> that predominantly employ men (SEforAll, 2018).
                        In some cases, <strong>women (and children)</strong>
                        spend on average 1.4 hours a day
                        collecting solid fuels and several
                        hours cooking with inefficient stoves,
                        leaving them less time to pursue other
                        economic, family or leisure activities

                        capital such as financial literacy
                        and entrepreneurial management.
                        As such, women are more likely to
                        partake in minor income-generating
                        activities in informal sectors related
                        to cooking and sewing, and less
                        likely to participate in more technical
                        sectors such as renewable energy.
                        The low profitability of these women led
                        businesses in the informal sector
                        results in a lower likelihood that
                        households will invest in women’s
                        education and training. This creates a
                        vicious cycle that relegates women to
                        informal and unpaid work.

                    </br>
                    The “solar mama” programme at the Barefoot College is a well-documented example of the democratising
                    power of <strong>off-grid renewable energy solutions</strong> and the transformative potential of training women in
                    <strong>rural areas</strong>. The programme has trained over 1000 women from more than 80 countries, leading to the
                    deployment of at least 18000 solar systems.

                    </br>                    
                    The trainees are often <strong>illiterate or semi-literate
                        women</strong> who maintain strong roots in their
                    rural villages and have the potential to play a
                    key role in bringing <strong>off-grid solar solutions
                        to remote, inaccessible villages</strong>. The initiative
                    works to demystify the technology and place it
                    in the hands of local communities.

                    Over a period
                    of six months, trainees receive instruction

                        cookers, water heaters and other devices</strong>. The
                    women return to their villages with equipment

                    <u>The case of Hivos’

                    </br>
                    In 2011, Hivos, a Dutch development aid
                    organisation, was engaged in eight domestic
                    biogas and two improved cookstove
                    programmes in Africa and Asia. After assessing
                    gender mainstreaming in policy and practice, it
                    concluded that core issues of gender inequality
                    were not always being addressed sufficiently.
                    It called for a better understanding of gender
                    issues in all programmes and <strong>identified concrete
                        opportunities for mainstreaming</strong>.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    The cooking energy programmes, including the
                    African Biogas Partnership Programme and
                    Program Biogas Rumah in Indonesia, had not all
                    defined gender goals from their inception. Gender equality was integrated in the programme’s planning,
                    implementation, monitoring and institutional set-up from 2011 onwards. For instance, <strong>training approaches
                        within biogas programmes have been adapted to address gender issues more effectively</strong> to ensure that
                    women and men are equally engaged. In all countries, the <strong>proportion of women trainees has gone up
                        significantly</strong>, with positive outcomes for long-term sustainability and socio-economic benefits.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    As part of its Sumba Island Initiative in Indonesia, Hivos is working with the local and national government
                    to devise approaches to integrate gender in the renewable energy sector. Hivos has capacitated four local
                    civil society organisations who coach or mentor local entrepreneurs and users of renewable energy systems
                    on <strong>identifying gender gaps and ways to address them including building shared-vision between husband
                        and wife </strong>from the energy access they have for better a livelihood. At the national level, Hivos has engaged
                    Ministry of Women Empowerment and Child Protection, to together identify potential gender integration
                    models in the sector with two test locations: Sumba and Salatiga, Central Java.

                        delivering energy solutions, they
                        take on more leadership in their
                        communities and consequently
                        facilitate a gradual paradigm shift in the social and cultural norms that
                        traditionally acted as barriers to their
                        agency. Active engagement further
                        contributes to women’s economic and
                        financial independence by increasing
                        income-generating opportunities
                        and enhancing women’s social and
                        political status (box below).

                            <u>Empowering women brewers in Burkina Faso through energy-efficient
                                cookstoves.</u>

                            Burkina Faso’s traditional small-scale beer-brewing sector is predominantly <strong>led by women and is an important
                                source of income for rural women</strong>. But poorly designed, inefficient cookstoves cause health problems and require
                            longer cooking times and higher fuel consumption.
                            </br>
                            </br>                            
                            In 2012, a programme to install over 500 energy-efficient cookstoves reached an estimated 800 women by
                            helping them <strong>build clusters</strong> that <strong>identify and promote their business development priorities</strong> including financial
                            management, technology upgrading and improving the hygiene of the production. The women were<strong> grouped
                                together in associations and encouraged to use self-help groups to finance the purchase of improved cook
                                stoves</strong>. The programme also establishes a credit risk guarantee mechanism to help women access additional
                            financing. They were also trained on how to operate and maintain the energy-efficient cookstoves. The women
                            were also motivated to initiate the formation of a nationwide federation for beer brewers to pursue the common
                            interests of women working in the sector.
                            </br>
                            </br>                            
                            Following the implementation of the project, women’s profits and income increased and they had more
                            social standing within their communities. The <strong>high efficiency of the cookstoves</strong> also reduced the amount of
                            firewood required by over 40%, thus also reducing the health risks and physical or sexual assault risks to
                            women collecting firewood.

                        often
                        because
                        they
                        have
                        no
                        capital
                        to
                        invest
                        and no collateral against which to
                        borrow. They are much more likely
                        to pursue employment opportunities
                        in renewable energy if they can earn
                        incomes without becoming indebted.
                        Acquiring new skills – such as learning
                        to build and repair renewable energy
                        technologies – is often better suited
                        to
                        their
                        economic
                        realities
                        and

            <h4>Improving the
	collection of gender disaggregated
	data</h4>
            
            <p>
                The lack of gender-disaggregated
                data exacerbates the gender gap
                within
                the
                energy
                access
                field
                because it distorts perceptions of
                the level of gender inequality within
                the sector. This hinders <strong>baseline
                    evaluations of gender inequality</strong>
                which
                underpin
                the
                development
                of
                gender-sensitive
                targets
                and
                indicators, the same targets and indicators that subsequently inform
                gender-sensitive
                programmes
                and
                policies. The result is a decrease
                in the effectiveness and accuracy
                of
                gender-responsive
                strategies.

                For the differences between men
                and women across social, economic,
                environmental, political and cultural
                dimensions
                to
                be
                fully
                grasped,
                both
                <strong>qualitative and quantitative
                    data collection</strong> and analyses are
                necessary. Progress is being made and
                a greater attention is being paid to the collection and reporting of gender
                disaggregated
                data (box below).

                    <u>Gathering gender-disaggregated data through household surveys.</u>
			        </br>
                    <strong>Household survey data</strong> provide a better picture of energy access than data from service providers. By
                    capturing more indicators, such surveys enable analysis of access trends across <strong>socio-economic segments</strong>
                    (e.g., urban vs. rural, male- vs. female-headed households). The World Bank’s Global Poverty Working Group
                    Database analyses datasets of household-level data, including household electrification status and gender
                    of head of household, allowing valuable insights on how (and where) access varies.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    Gender-disaggregated data show that <strong>electricity access for male- and female-headed households differs
                        only slightly </strong>overall – 33% and 31%, respectively. <strong>Disparities emerge for some countries</strong>, however. In some
                    countries (Ethiopia, Mali, Nigeria), access rates for female-headed households are two percentage points
                    higher; in others (Angola, Bangladesh, Chad, Sudan, Zambia), male-headed households enjoy substantially
                    higher access rates.
