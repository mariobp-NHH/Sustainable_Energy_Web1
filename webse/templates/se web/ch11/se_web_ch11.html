                        In this chapter we will focus on the analysis of the Sustainable Development Goal 7: Energy.
                        In particular, we focus on four points: Access to electricity; access to clean fuels and technologies
                        for cooking; renewable energy; and energy efficiency. We will establish bridges between SDG7 and other Sustainable Development Goals.

            <h3>Main trends</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>The global trend</strong>: The world has made striking progress over the past decade far more than in previous
                decades in increasing access to electricity. The share of the world’s population having access to electricity grew
                <strong>from 83 percent in 2010 to 90 percent in 2018</strong>. An increase of more than a billion people. During this period,
                the number of people without access to electricity fell from about 1.2 billion to 789 million, outpacing the overall
                increase in population. Trends from 2016 to 2018 show accelerated electrification (with the average annual rate of
                electrification increasing to 0.82 percentage points) compared with 2010–16 (0.77 points) (Figure: Percentage of population with access to electricity).

                    <strong>Target for 2030</strong>:
                    Despite accelerated progress in recent years, the world <strong>will fall short of SDG indicator 7, which aims for 100 percent access to electricity by 2030</strong>, if the current rate is maintained. Due to the many challenges
                    facing access-deficit countries,<strong> the latest projection shows that about 620 million people would still lack access
                        to electricity in 2030</strong> (IEA 2019a). To close the gap, the annual rate of electrification would have to rise from the
                    current 0.82 percentage points to 0.87 percentage points for the years 2019 to 2030. Moreover, this projection
                    does not account for the disruptions of covid-19. These have not yet been quantified, but they will likely affect
                    electrification, slowing and in some cases even reversing advances (e.g., as utilities and off-grid service providers
                    face financial difficulties). Governments, hand in hand with the international community, should be prepared to
                    mitigate these adverse effects to safeguard the gains in access.

                        The global advance in access to electricity since 2010 masks unequal progress across
                        regions, with attention now focusing on Sub-Saharan Africa. Latin America and the Caribbean and Eastern Asia
                        and South-eastern Asia approached universal access, exceeding 98 percent access to electricity by 2018. In
                        Central Asia and Southern Asia, more than 92 percent of the population had access by 2018. The world’s access
                        deficit is increasingly concentrated in Sub-Saharan Africa, which, in 2018, was home to about 548 million people
                        who lacked access more than half of the region’s population and nearly 70 percent of the global population
                        without access. After 2010, access advances in Sub-Saharan Africa outpaced population growth, but the trend has
                        reversed recently. Between 2016 and 2018, the number of people in the region lacking access remained almost
                        stable (Figure: Annual increase in access to electricity rate in access-deficit countries, 2010-18).

                  <p class="text-right">
                        Rural populations made up about 85 percent (668 million people) of the
                        global access deficit in 2018. But, since 2010, they have seen more progress than the urban deficit populations.
                        Globally, the access rate in rural areas grew from about 70 percent in 2010 to 80 percent in 2018. During the
                        same period, the rate of urban electrification grew from 95 to 97 percent. While approaching universal access,
                        urban electrification nevertheless faces policy and technical challenges. The obstacles to supplying electricity to
                        surging urban populations have slowed gains since 2010. Unstable distribution networks have made it difficult to
                        connect pockets of people in urban cores and in sprawling settlements that ring large cities. In the coming years,
                        the access rate is more likely to advance in rural areas than in cities (Figure: Gains in electricity access in urban and rural areas, 2000, 2010, and 2018).

            <h3>Providing electricity to record numbers of forcibly displaced people</h3>

            <p>
                Today, forcible displacement affects a record number of <strong>75 million people around the world</strong>, including almost
                24 million refugees and asylum seekers. Of the 75 million forcibly displaced people at the end of 2018, about 20
                million were refugees and over 3.5 million were asylum seekers (UNHCR, 2019).
                </br>
                </br>
                Historically, humanitarian and development actors do not provide access to electricity among refugee
                households. They lack the expertise and funding to do so, for a start. Some host governments are reluctant to
                authorize long-term infrastructure for refugee settlements that are optimistically considered temporary.
                Electricity access for displaced populations is now receiving growing attention, though reliable information and
                monitoring are scarce.

                    The best globally comparable data presently available come from the Integrated Refugee

                (UNHCR). The system is a global monitoring toolkit accessible at:

                Existing data shows that refugees have disproportionately lower access to grid electricity than their surrounding
                host communities. According to the UNHCR findings, the most striking cases were in Rwanda
                (Gihembe, Kigeme, Mugombwa, Nyabiheke) and Tanzania (Nyarugusu), where just <strong>10 percent of refugees had
                    access to the electricity grid in 2018, compared with 25–37 percent in the host communities</strong>. In Cameroon
                (Douala, Gbiti, Kette, Meiganga, Minawao), only <strong>5 percent of the refugees had access to the grid in 2018,
                    compared with 25 percent in the host communities</strong>. In Bangladesh, the gap between the refugees in 10 camps
                in Cox’s Bazar and the host community was particularly stark: <strong>no refugees had access to grid power, whereas
                    up to 80 percent of the host community had access</strong>. In other countries, including Burkina Faso (Gandafabou,
                Goudebo, Mentao), Chad (Aradib, Djabal, Goz Amer), and South Sudan (Doro, Ezo, Gendrassa, Kaya, Lasu, Yusuf
                Batil), neither refugees nor the host communities had access, underlining the poverty of areas hosting refugees
                in many countries.

            <h3>Energizing women</h3>
            
            <p>
                Access to electricity plays a critical role in<strong> poverty reduction for women and girls</strong>. Women’s employment and leisure will
                improve with increased access to electricity. Poor electricity supply was pinpointed as the biggest obstacle to growth
                by 25 percent of female-headed enterprises surveyed in Tanzania and 19 percent in Ghana. Statistical data from these
                countries show a positive relationship between the productive use of electricity and women’s economic empowerment.
                Use of electrical appliances allowed for diversification in products for sale and helped female entrepreneurs attract
                more customers. The provision of electric light amplifies time savings by increasing efficiency and
                adding flexibility in the scheduling of household tasks. Freeing up women’s time is a prerequisite for investments in
                their education and life choices, encouraging them to seize economic opportunities and participate in economic,
                political, and social life (World Bank 2012).

                Electrification projects can promote gender equality in several ways. For example, ensuring that the upfront cost of
                electricity provision and electric appliances is affordable to women and women-led businesses who are less likely
                to have access to finance would facilitate grid and off-grid connections and the use of energy services. Also, gender
                disparities can be ameliorated with approaches that ensure women have the same opportunity as men to benefit from
                improved income-generating activities. With a focus on closing gender gaps in employment and skills development,
                projects can also address <strong>women’s underrepresentation in the energy sector workforce</strong>. IRENA’s online gender survey
                from 2018 highlighted access to training and skills development programs. In fact, these were seen as a key measure
                to improve women’s engagement in deploying renewables for energy access (IRENA, 2019).To ensure that gender is
                factored into energy projects, specific actions throughout the project cycle are required: a gender-gap assessment, a
                plan of action for interventions, and a focus on monitoring and evaluation that tracks the narrowing of gender gaps.
                An in-country example from Ethiopia where the government has launched a reform of its energy sector to reach
                universal electrification by 2025 aims to create more equitable institutions and equal benefits for women. A first-of
                its-
                kind approach, the NEP and NEP 2.0 initiatives established new ways of looking at gender, focusing on constraints
                in employment, child care, sexual harassment, female entrepreneurship, and consumer-level affordability (World Bank,
                2020b).

            <h3>Supporting other SDGs by supplying power to education facilities and health centers</h3>
            
            <p>
                Providing electricity to schools and health centers offers broad benefits that will assist in reaching objectives
                codified in a range of SDGs, most directly <strong>SDG 3 (health)</strong> and <strong>4 (education)</strong> but also <strong>SDG 5 (gender)</strong> and<strong> SDG 8
                    (work and economic growth)</strong>. The Multi-Tier Framework (MTF) team collected information from public institutions including health and
                education facilities as a part of the household survey.
                </br>
                </br>
                <u>Education facilities.</u>
                </br>
                </br>
                In 2018, the Multi-Tier Framework (MTF) survey compiled data in public institutions in Cambodia, Ethiopia, Kenya,
                Myanmar, Nepal, and Niger. The data were collected at the facility level by interviewing officers best positioned to
                respond at the institutions.

                <div>
                    In the surveyed countries, 31 percent of educational facilities are electrified through an on-grid source of electricity
                    and 9 percent through off-grid systems; 60 percent have no access to electricity.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    The national public grid is the primary source of electricity for educational facilities with access to power. More
                    specifically, 49 percent of schools in Nepal are electrified through the public grid, 72 percent in Kenya, and only 22
                    percent in Ethiopia. An exception to this trend is Niger, where solar energy sources, including solar home/lighting
                    systems, mini grids, and batteries, are primary providers of electricity for 3 percent of schools. Education facilities
                    also rely on solar as backup power to cover urgent energy demand. This is the case for 86 percent of facilities in
                    Cambodia and 15 percent of schools in Kenya (Figure: Electrification of schools, by source).

                </br>
                The covid-19 pandemic highlights the need for reliable and affordable electricity to health centers. MTF collected
                data across 730 health centers, including clinics and hospitals in Cambodia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Myanmar, Nepal,
                and Niger.

                <div>
                    Across the surveyed countries, around 75 percent of health facilities have access to a primary source of electricity
                    (42 percent through grid access, 33 percent through off-grid solutions), while 25 percent remain unelectrified.
                    These aggregate results mask large discrepancies at the country level, as well as quality and reliability of supply.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    In Kenya, 77 percent of health centers rely on the public national grid to cover their primary electricity needs. At
                    the same time, 66 percent of health centers in Cambodia use off-grid solutions to cover their primary electricity
                    demand, and 83 percent of them use solar systems as a backup power source (Figure: Electrification of health centers, by source).
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>
                The health centers use electricity mainly for lighting (57 percent), refrigerators for vaccines (40 percent), and
                fans or evaporative air-cooling systems (28 percent). They also reported, however, that the use of electric powered
                medical appliances is limited owing to no availability, high cost, and insufficient energy.
                </br>
                </br>
                In every country analyzed, the power supply is compromised by unscheduled interruptions and voltage
                fluctuations. Twenty-five percent of health facilities reported that unscheduled outages affect the capacity
                to deliver essential health services. Damage to equipment caused by poor-quality connections and frequent
                voltage fluctuations are also constraints for 28 percent of health centers.

                        In 2018, 63 percent of the global population had access to clean cooking
                        fuels and technologies; the global population without access was 2.8 billion people. Without prompt
                        action, universal access will fall short of SDG goals by almost 30 percent. Meanwhile, exposure to household
                        air pollution will continue to contribute to millions of deaths from noncommunicable diseases (including heart
                        disease, stroke, and cancer) and pneumonia. Household air pollution will continue to worsen climate change (Figure: The global population with access to clean cooking (in percentages)).

                        The annual rate of access to clean cooking fuels and technologies from 2010 to
                        2018 increased by less than one percentage point (pp) as population growth outpaced the number of those with
                        access. In the decade leading up to 2030, increases in excess of 3pp per year are required to achieve the goal of
                        universal access to clean fuels and technologies by 2030.

                        Greater access to clean cooking was achieved largely in two regions of Asia. From 2010 to 2018, Eastern
                        Asia and South-eastern Asia saw annualized increases in access of 1.6pp while the numbers of
                        people lacking access fell from 1.0 billion  to 0.8 billion. Central Asia and Southern Asia also saw
                        improved access to clean cooking, with annualized increases of 1.5pp. The 1.11 billion people without
                        access dropped to 1.0 billion. In Sub-Saharan Africa, meanwhile, a stagnant access rate (annualized
                        increase of 0.4pp) combined with rapid population growth have meant that the numbers of people without access
                        have risen from 750 million people to 890 million people (Figure: Regional populations, by rate of access to clean cooking fuels, 2018).
                        </br>
                        </br>
                        Over the period 2014-2018, population growth in Sub-Saharan Africa outstripped growth in the number of people with access to
                        clean cooking by around 18 million people each year. Thus, in this region 894 million (874–911) people, or around 85
                        percent of the population, lack access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking.
                        </br>
                        </br>
                        As a result, in 2018, around 3 billion people lacked access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking. Furthermore, if
                        trends continue without changes in policy, the access deficit will shrink from 2.8 to 2.7 billion people (2.0–3.5) by 2030,
                        about half of them in Sub-Saharan Africa and a quarter of them in Central Asia and Southern Asia. Using IEA’s Stated
                        Policies Scenario, 2.3 billion people will still lack access in 2030 under current and planned policies (IEA 2019). Action
                        is urgently needed.

                  <p class="text-right">
                        There are urban-rural discrepancies worldwide in access to clean cooking fuels and
                        technologies: 83 percent of the people living in urban areas have access to clean fuels and technologies, compared with 37 percent
                        of those living in the countryside. These discrepancies have been shrinking since 2010 owing, first, to increased
                        access in rural areas, and, second, to population growth in the cities that is beginning to outpace access.
                        </br>
                        </br>
                        Between 2000 and 2010 the disparity between urban areas and rural areas in access to clean cooking was fairly
                        constant at just over 50 percentage points (52pp [45–57] in 2010), but this has steadily fallen over the past decade,
                        to 46pp (36–55) in 2018. This is explained by trend changes in the annual increase in
                        access to clean fuels and technologies for urban and rural areas. In rural areas, the annual increase
                        has risen consistently, from only 0.2pp between 2000 and 2001 to 1.2pp between 2017 and 2018. In contrast, the
                        annual increase in urban areas has fallen consistently over the past decade, from a high of 0.6pp between 2007 and
                        2008 to only 0.2pp between 2017 and 2018. This means that while access has accelerated in the countryside, it has
                        been decelerating in urban areas. In fact, if observed trends continue and population growth outpaces access to clean
                        fuels, the proportion with access to clean cooking is projected to decline in urban areas as the new decade begins.
                        Meanwhile, some countries with rapid access growth will reach near-universal access, from which point increased
                        access is no longer possible.

                        From 2014 to 2018, 20 countries accounted for more than 80 percent of the global population without access to clean cooking fuel.17 In terms of the percentage of the national
                        population lacking access, 19 of the 20 countries with the lowest percentage of the population having access were
                        least-developed countries in Africa. Of these, 15 had annualized increases in access over the same period of less
                        than 0.1pp, with some of these displaying potential decreases in access.

                  <p class="text-right">
                        In low- and middle-income countries of Central Asia and Southern Asia, Eastern and South-eastern Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, Oceania, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Western Asia and Northern Africa, the
                        use of <strong>gaseous fuels </strong>(liquefied petroleum gas [LPG], natural gas, and biogas) continues to increase. Since 2010,
                        gas has overtaken unprocessed biomass fuels as the dominant fuel worldwide. (Unprocessed biomass, charcoal,
                        coal, and kerosene are considered polluting fuels.) In <strong>urban areas</strong>, the use of <strong>electricity</strong> for cooking has risen, but
                        gas remains the most common fuel. In <strong>rural areas</strong>, meanwhile, a decline in the use of polluting fuel, particularly
                        raw coal, has been accompanied by increased use of <strong>gas</strong>, though <strong>unprocessed biomass fuels </strong>remain dominant.
                        Finally, the global proportion using charcoal is low, but charcoal has overtaken unprocessed biomass in Sub-Saharan cities.

                        Since 2010, only small improvements in access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking have been realized. Although Asia has made notable gains, stagnant growth in access, combined with rapid population
                        growth, have brought progress in Sub-Saharan Africa to a standstill. If this trend continues, any hope of achieving
                        universal access rates by 2030 will be quashed, leaving a third of the global population vulnerable not only to
                        adverse health effects but also to social and economic disadvantages. The latter is especially true for women and
                        children, who shoulder time-consuming household tasks of gathering fuel and tending smoky stoves. These tasks
                        take them away from remunerative work on the one hand while on the other subject them to adverse environmental
                        conditions. That said, universal access remains achievable if serious efforts were made toward accelerating the
                        transition to clean cooking worldwide, and particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa.

                    During 2018, 2.8 billion people were exposed to household air pollution. This exposure has been previously linked
                    to high blood pressure and respiratory and cardiovascular disease. The use of polluting fuels increases the risk of burns, injuries, poisoning, chronic headaches, and many other
                    ills. The most vulnerable group thus exposed are<strong> women and children</strong>, as they are traditionally the procurers and users
                    of polluting household fuels.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    In access-deficit countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, a sizable percentage of children spend time gathering fuels. In
                    addition, based on WHO statistics, the<strong> procurement of fuels is predominantly done by girls over boys</strong> (Figure: Percentages of girls and boys who gather wood and water).
                    This imbalance creates a bias from an early age as girls spend more time procuring fuels instead of other activities, for
                    example, receiving education.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    The degradation of household air quality because of polluting cooking fuels affects all household members. Some
                    studies show, however, that the concentration of particles in the air increases drastically during meal preparation. This
                    has an outsized effect on women and children because they are traditionally tasked with cooking.

            <h3>Clean cooking and gender</h3>
            <p>
                In developing countries around the world, millions of women and girls live in energy poverty, risking their lives
                every day by working long, arduous hours to secure the energy needed by their households to cook their family’s
                meals. The time spent cooking over inefficient stoves and procuring fuel restricts women’s ability to partake in
                paid, as well as educational, political, and social activities, thereby perpetuating gender inequality, economic
                poverty, and a persistent drudgery trap. In addition to cooking, women also endure incredible hardships for fuel
                acquisition walking long distances searching for fuel and carrying heavy loads of firewood and water. Displaced
                women have even worse burdens, in many cases having to walk for hours to find firewood, sometimes spending
                the night outside of camps set up for displaced people, and thus increasing their vulnerability to physical and
                sexual attack, dehydration, and other injuries. As the primary cooks in most developing-country households,
                women are more susceptible than men to household air pollution, as they are more likely to inhale toxic smoke
                from inefficient cooking fires.
                </br>

                <div>
                    An in-depth analysis using data from Uganda shows that although female- and male-headed households
                    show similar rates of access to clean cooking (at the country level, as well as in urban and rural areas), female
                    headed
                    households tend to have better access to clean cooking than male-headed households as household
                    expenditure level increases. Among the richest 40 percent of households, women have greater access to
                    improved cookstoves and clean-fuel stoves  than men. In terms of
                    <strong>household time spent on cooking</strong>, women and girls spend much more time than men and boys. In Uganda,
                    women (15 years and older) spend on average 3.8 hours per day cooking, and girls spend close to 30 minutes.
                    In contrast, men and boys are virtually not involved in cooking. Similarly, female household members will often
                    spend much more time<strong> acquiring and preparing fuel</strong> than men and boys. In Uganda, women spend 3.4 hours per
                    week in cooking fuel acquisition and preparation over 7.5 times more time than men (Figure: Time spent acquiring fuel and preparing food, by gender).

            </div>

            <p>
                The introduction of clean cooking fuels can drastically reduce the time women spend on unpaid household meal
                preparation; clean cooking also promotes more cost-efficient fuels and thus financial savings in the long term.
                The time and income recovered from these household activities free up space and opportunities for women and
                girls, helping to lift them out of energy poverty. Time spent collecting fuelwood can be intensive: in India, time
                spent collecting firewood ranges from three to ten hours per week. Nigerian households
                spend an average of 1.7 hours per day gathering firewood (WHO 2019). In Kenya, households working with
                improved cookstoves saw the time spent collecting fuel drop from an average of 12 hours per week to 5 hours 
                and most participants reported using the time saved for economically productive tasks (WLPGA 2014).
                </br>
                </br>
                Case studies have shown that when women receive <strong>empowerment training to sell stoves</strong>, they can dramatically
                increase sales. For example, in Nepal and Kenya women doubled sales after training. In a pilot project supported
                by the Clean Cooking Alliance with the Girl Guides in Ghana, 200 girls received training in empowerment,
                entrepreneurship, and cooking technologies and fuels. Afterwards, each household purchased efficient
                cookstoves. As a result, the girls reported a 50 percent reduction in cooking time, as well as two hours saved
                per firewood collection trip. In 2014, a research study commissioned by the Clean Cooking Alliance in Kenya
                found that women cookstove entrepreneurs sold three times as many cookstoves as their male peers when
                given the same training and support. Additionally, women’s networks provide access to consumers in hard-to
                reach
                markets, and women distributors better understand the needs of women and more easily approach their
                clients.
                </br>
                </br>
                When women are positioned as the critical stakeholders they are both as users who will benefit from cleaner,
                more efficient stoves and fuels, and as entrepreneurs and employees in the value chain, their efforts clearly
                spur widespread adoption. Women have a role to play in every segment of the cooking value chain, and their
                involvement can scale adoption of cooking products and services, while boosting their livelihoods. Women’s
                involvement in the clean cooking sector can spur widespread distribution and delivery of cooking fuels and
                technologies that will contribute to a thriving global industry.

                                    In access-deficit countries in <strong>Sub-Saharan Africa</strong>, a sizable percentage of <strong>children</strong> spend time gathering fuels. In
                                    addition, based on WHO statistics, the<strong> procurement of fuels is predominantly done by girls over boys</strong> (Figure: Percentages of girls and boys who gather wood and water).

                        Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7 posits a substantial increase in the share of renewable
                        energy in total final energy consumption (TFEC). Meeting this target will require the penetration of renewable
                        energy to accelerate in all three  <strong>end uses electricity </strong>,  <strong>heat </strong>, and  <strong>transport </strong>. In 2017, the share of renewable energy in
                        TFEC increased to 17.3 percent, up from 17.2 percent in 2016. This rise reflects a more rapid growth in renewables
                        (2.5 percent) compared with the overall growth of TFEC (+1.8 percent). Renewable energy consumption  <strong>has grown
                            fastest in the power sector </strong>; growth of renewables consumption in the  <strong>heat and transport sectors has been much
                            slower </strong>. Excluding the traditional uses of biomass, the share of renewables in TFEC rose to
                        10.5 percent in 2017, up from 10.3 percent in 2016

                        Although there is no quantitative target for SDG 7.2, countries have agreed that the share of renewable energy would need to accelerate substantially to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable,
                        and modern energy for all. Despite impressive growth in renewable energy over the past decade, the world is not
                        on track to meet the SDG 7 target.

                        At 69 percent of TFEC, Sub-Saharan Africa continues to show, by far, the highest share of renewable energy. The traditional uses of biomass, however, still account for almost 85 percent of renewable
                        energy consumption in the region, while modern renewable energy is below the world average. Latin America
                        and the Caribbean, on the other hand, had the largest share of modern renewables (29 percent) thanks to the
                        extensive use of modern bioenergy and hydropower. In Asia, modern renewable energy shares remained below
                        the global average at around 8 percent of the regional TFEC.

                        The share of renewable consumption varies by country. Between 2010 to 2017, 13 out of the top 20 energy-consuming countries increased their share of renewables. The United
                        Kingdom in particular saw the largest relative increase, led by wind energy. Yet in Brazil, India, Indonesia, Nigeria,
                        Pakistan, and Turkey, renewables have grown more slowly than total energy consumption.

                        Renewable electricity consumption increased by almost 6 percent year-on-year in 2017. In relative terms, this meant that the share of renewables in global electricity consumption reached 24.7 percent, the highest
                        of all end-use sectors. With this growth, the renewables share in electricity surpassed its share in heat for the
                        first time in history. In terms of growth rate, however, this represents a deceleration compared with the record
                        year-on-year growth recorded in 2016. Lower hydropower output was the main reason behind the slower increase
                        in renewables.

                        thanks to policy support (among other factors) in Brazil, the European Union, and the United States. In 2017,
                        consumption of electricity in the transport sector was 1.3 exajoules (EJ), of which 24 percent was renewable
                        (0.3 EJ), representing 0.3 percent of global energy consumption in the transport sector.

                    After a period of relative stability, the rate of global primary energy intensity defined as the
                    percentage decrease in the ratio of global total primary energy supply per unit of gross domestic product (GDP)
                    has slowed in recent years. Global primary energy intensity was 5.01 megajoules (MJ) per U.S. dollar (2011 PPP
                    [purchasing power parity]) in 2017, a 1.7 percent improvement from 2016. This was the lowest rate of improvement
                    since 2010 (Figure: Global primary energy intensity and its annual change, 1990–2017).

                    Energy intensity improvements are moving further away from the target set under the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) for 2030. Between 2010 and 2017 the average annual rate of
                    improvement in global primary energy intensity was 2.2 percent. Although better than the rate of 1.3 percent
                    between 1990 and 2010, it is well below the SDG 7 target of 2.6 percent which would have doubled the historic

                Annual improvement until 2030 will now need to average over 3 percent to meet the target set in SDG 7.

                3 percent annual increases needed to reach SDG target 7 or even the 2.2 percent seen between 2010 and 2017.

                </br>
                Asia is where more robust, continuous improvements are seen in energy intensity than in any other world region. Between 2010 and 2017, primary energy intensity in Eastern Asia and South-eastern
                Asia improved by an annual average rate of 3.3 percent. Similarly, in Central Asia and Southern Asia and Oceania,
                the average annual improvement rate of 2.5 percent between 2010 and 2017 was above the global average
                (2.2 percent) and an improvement on historic trends. Rates of improvement were just below the global average
                in Northern America and Europe (2.1 percent), with the lowest rates of improvement in Sub-Saharan Africa
                (1.3 percent), Western Asia and Northern Africa (1 percent), and Latin America (0.9 percent) (Figure: Growth rate of GDP, primary energy demand, and regional energy intensity, 2010–17). Data on absolute
                energy intensity reveal wide regional differences: the most energy-intensive region is Sub-Saharan Africa, and
                Latin America and the Caribbean the least. These variations likely mirror not energy efficiency so much as
                economic structure, energy supply, and access.

                </br>
                Although global energy intensity improved across all sectors during the period 2010–17, the rate differs by sector. Using different intensity metrics, the rate of improvement declined compared with the period
                1990–2010 in all sectors except transport, where fuel-efficiency standards drove improvements. The decline in
                the rate of improvement from one period to the other is most noticeable in services, agriculture, and, to a lesser

                rapid improvements in energy intensity during the period 1990–2010 as they mechanized production and shifted
                to higher-value goods and services (Figure: Growth rate of energy intensity by sector, 1990–2010 and 2010–17).
