            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <p>
                Wind power is one of the fastest-growing renewable energy technologies. Usage is on the rise worldwide,
                in part because costs are falling. Global installed wind-generation capacity onshore and offshore has increased
                by a factor of almost 75 in the past two decades, jumping from 7.5 gigawatts (GW) in 1997 to some 564 GW by 2018.
                Production of wind electricity doubled between 2009 and 2013, and in 2016 wind energy accounted for 16% of the
                electricity generated by renewables. Many parts of the world have strong wind speeds, but the best locations for
                generating wind power are sometimes remote ones. Offshore wind power offers tremendous potential.
                </br>
                </br>
                Wind-turbine capacity has increased over time. In 1985, typical turbines had a rated capacity of 0.05
                megawatts (MW) and a rotor diameter of 15 metres. Today’s new wind power projects have turbine capacities
                of about 2 MW onshore and 3–5 MW offshore.
                </br>
                </br>
                Commercially available wind turbines have reached 8 MW capacity, with rotor diameters of up to 164 metres.
                The average capacity of wind turbines increased from 1.6 MW in 2009 to 2 MW in 2014.

            <h2>History</h2>

            <p>
                Wind turbines first emerged more than a century ago. Following the invention of the electric generator in
                the 1830s, engineers started attempting to harness wind energy to produce electricity.
                Wind power generation took place in the United Kingdom and the United States in 1887 and 1888,
                but modern wind power is considered to have been first developed in Denmark, where horizontal-axis wind
                turbines were built in 1891 and a 22.8-metre wind turbine began operation in 1897.
                </br>
                </br>
                <u>People have been using wind energy for thousands of years.</u>
                </br>
                </br>
                People used wind energy to propel boats along the Nile River as early as 5,000 BC. By 200 BC,
                simple wind-powered water pumps were used in China, and windmills with woven-reed blades were grinding
                grain in Persia and the Middle East.
                </br>
                </br>
                New ways to use wind energy eventually spread around the world. By the 11th century, people in the
                Middle East were using wind pumps and windmills extensively for food production. Merchants and the
                Crusaders brought wind technology to Europe. The Dutch developed large windpumps to drain lakes and
                marshes in the Rhine River Delta. Immigrants from Europe eventually took wind energy technology to the
                Western Hemisphere.
                </br>
                </br>
                American colonists used windmills to grind grain, to pump water, and to cut wood at sawmills.
                Homesteaders and ranchers installed thousands of wind pumps as they settled the western United States.
                In the late 1800s and early 1900s, small wind-electric generators (wind turbines) were also widely used.
                </br>
                </br>
                The number of wind pumps and wind turbines declined as rural electrification programs in the 1930’s extended
                power lines to most farms and ranches across the country. However, some ranches still use wind pumps to
                supply water for livestock. Small wind turbines are becoming more common again, mainly to supply electricity
                in remote and rural areas.
                </br>
                </br>
                <u>Wind energy use expanded in the wake of oil shortages and environmental concerns.</u>
                </br>
                </br>
                The oil shortages of the 1970s changed the energy environment for the United States and the world.
                The oil shortages created an interest in developing ways to use alternative energy sources, such as wind energy,
                to generate electricity. The U.S. federal government supported research and development of large wind turbines.
                In the early 1980s, thousands of wind turbines were installed in California, largely because of federal and state
                policies that encouraged the use of renewable energy sources.
                </br>
                </br>
                In the 1990s and 2000s, the U.S. federal government established incentives to use renewable energy
                sources in response to a renewed concern for the environment. The federal government also provided
                research and development funding to help reduce the cost of wind turbines and offered tax and investment
                incentives for wind power projects. In addition, state governments enacted new requirements for electricity
                generation from renewable sources, and electric power marketers and utilities began to offer electricity generated
                from wind and other renewable energy sources (sometimes called green power) to their customers. These policies and
                programs resulted in an increase in the number of wind turbines and in the amount of electricity generated from wind energy.
                </br>
                </br>
                The share of U.S. electricity generation from wind grew from less than 1% in 1990 to about 7.3% in 2019.
                Incentives in Europe have resulted in a large expansion of wind energy use there. China has invested heavily in
                wind energy and is now the world's largest wind electricity generator. In 1990, 16 countries generated a total of
                about 3.6 billion kWh of wind electricity. In 2017, 129 countries generated a total of about 1.13 trillion kWh
                of wind electricity.

            <h3>How wind turbines work</h3>

            <p>
                Wind turbines use blades to collect the wind’s kinetic energy. Wind flows over the blades creating lift
                (similar to the effect on airplane wings), which causes the blades to turn. The blades are connected to
                a drive shaft that turns an electric generator, which produces (generates) electricity.
            </p>

            <h3>Energy from moving air</h3>

            <p>
                Wind is caused by uneven heating of the earth's surface by the sun. Because the earth's surface is made up of different types of
                land and water, it absorbs the sun's heat at different rates. One example of this uneven heating is the daily wind cycle.
                </br>
                </br>
                During the day, air above the land heats up faster than air over water. Warm air over land expands and rises, and heavier,
                cooler air rushes in to take its place, creating wind. At night, the winds are reversed because air cools more
                rapidly over land than it does over water.
            </p>

                    <p>
                        In the same way, the atmospheric winds that circle the earth are created because the land near the earth's equator is hotter than the land near the
                        North Pole and the South Pole. The global wind kinetic energy averaged approximately 1.50 MJ/m2 over the period from 1979 to 2010,
                        1.31 MJ/m2 in the Northern Hemisphere with 1.70 MJ/m2 in the Southern Hemisphere. The atmosphere acts as a thermal engine,
                        absorbing heat at higher temperatures, releasing heat at lower temperatures. The process is responsible for the production
                        of wind kinetic energy at a rate of 2.46 W/m2 sustaining thus the circulation of the atmosphere against frictional dissipation.

                        </br>
                        Wind is used to produce electricity using the kinetic energy created by air in motion. This is transformed into electrical energy using wind turbines or
                        wind energy conversion systems. Wind first hits a turbine’s blades, causing them to rotate and turn the turbine connected to them. That changes the
                        kinetic energy to rotational energy, by moving a shaft which is connected to a generator, and thereby producing electrical energy through
                        electromagnetism.
                        </br>
                        </br>
                        The amount of power that can be harvested from wind depends on the size of the turbine and the length of its blades. The output is
                        proportional to the dimensions of the rotor and to the cube of the wind speed. Theoretically, when wind speed doubles, wind power
                        potential increases by a factor of eight.

                3. The <strong>net capacity factor</strong> is the unitless ratio of an actual electrical energy output over a
                given period of time to the maximum possible electrical energy output over that period. The capacity
                factor is defined for any electricity producing installation, such as a fuel consuming power plant or
                one using renewable energy, such as wind or the sun. The average capacity factor can also be defined for
                any class of such installations, and can be used to compare different types of electricity production.

                Sites with lower capacity factors may be deemed feasible for wind farms, for example the
                onshore 1 GW Fosen Vind which as of 2017 is under construction in Norway has a projected capacity
                factor of 39%. Feasibility calculations may be affected by seasonality. For example in Finland, capacity
                factor during the cold winter months is more than double compared to July. While the annual average in Finland
                is 29.5%, the high demand for heating energy correlates with the higher capacity factor during the winter.

                4. The capacity factor of a wind turbine measures actual production relative to possible production, it is unrelated to
                <strong>Betz's coefficient</strong> of 16/27 = 59.3%, which limits production vs. energy available in the wind.
                </br>
                </br>
                Betz's law indicates the maximum power that can be extracted from the wind, independent of the design of a
                wind turbine in open flow. It was published in 1919 by the German physicist Albert Betz. The law is derived
                from the principles of conservation of mass and momentum of the air stream flowing through an idealized "actuator disk"
                that extracts energy from the wind stream. According to Betz's law, no turbine can capture more than 16/27=59.3%
                of the kinetic energy in wind. The factor 16/27 (0.593) is known as Betz's coefficient.
                Practical utility-scale wind turbines achieve at peak 75-80% of the Betz limit.

                    <u>Electricity is measured in Watts and kilowatts:</u>
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    Electricity is measured in units of power called Watts, named to honor James Watt, the inventor of
                    the steam engine. A Watt is the unit of electrical power equal to <strong>one ampere under the pressure of one volt</strong>.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    <strong>One Watt is a small amount of power.</strong> Some devices require only a few Watts to operate, and other devices require larger
                    amounts. The power consumption of small devices is usually measured in Watts, and the power consumption of larger devices
                    is measured in kilowatts (kW), or 1,000 Watts.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    Electricity generation capacity is often measured in multiples of kilowatts, such as megawatts (MW) and gigawatts (GW).
                    One MW is 1,000 kW (or 1,000,000 Watts), and one GW is 1,000 MW (or 1,000,000,000 Watts).
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    <u>Electricity use over time is measured in Watthours:</u>
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    A Watthour (Wh) is equal to the energy of one Watt steadily supplied to, or taken from, an electric circuit for
                    one hour. <strong>The amount of electricity that a power plant generates or an electric utility customer
                    uses is typically measured in kilowatthours (kWh)</strong>. One kWh is one kilowatt generated or consumed for one hour.
                    For example, if you use a 40-Watt (0.04 kW) light bulb for five hours, you have used 200 Wh, or 0.2 kWh, of electrical energy.

            <h3>Types of wind turbines</h3>

            <p>
                The size of wind turbines varies widely. The length of the blades is the biggest factor in determining
                the amount of electricity a wind turbine can generate. Small wind turbines that can power a single home
                may have an electricity generating capacity of 10 kilowatts (kW). The largest wind turbines in operation
                have electricity generating capacities of up to kilowatts (10 megawatts), and larger turbines are in development.
                Large turbines are often grouped together to create wind power plants, or wind farms, that provide power to electricity grids.
                </br>
                </br>
                There are two basic types of wind turbines

                      Horizontal-axis turbines have blades like airplane propellers, and they commonly have three blades.
                      The largest horizontal-axis turbines are as tall as 20-story buildings and have blades
                      more than 100 feet long. Taller turbines with longer blades generate more electricity.
                      Nearly all of the wind turbines currently in use are horizontal-axis turbines.

                      Vertical-axis turbines have blades that are attached to the top and the bottom of a vertical rotor.
                      The most common type of vertical-axis turbine—the Darrieus wind turbine, named after the French
                      engineer Georges Darrieus who patented the design in 1931—looks like a giant, two-bladed egg beater.
                      Some versions of the vertical-axis turbine are 100 feet tall and 50 feet wide. Very few vertical-axis wind
                      turbines are in use today because they do not perform as well as horizontal-axis turbines.

                    <strong>The levelized cost of energy (LCOE)</strong>, or levelized cost of electricity, is a measure
                    of the average net present cost of electricity generation for a generating plant over its lifetime.
                    The LCOE is calculated as the ratio between all the discounted costs over the lifetime of an electricity
                    generating plant divided by a discounted sum of the actual energy amounts delivered.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    The LCOE is used
                    to compare different methods of electricity generation on a consistent basis. The LCOE "represents the
                    average revenue per unit of electricity generated that would be required to recover the costs of building
                    and operating a generating plant during an assumed financial life and duty cycle." Inputs to LCOE are chosen
                    by the estimator. They can include cost of capital, "fuel costs, fixed and variable operations and maintenance costs,
                    financing costs, and an assumed utilization rate.

            <h2>Onshore and Offshore wind. Regional development</h2>
            <h3>Onshore wind</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>China</strong>’s onshore wind installed capacity would grow from 205 GW in 2018 (CWEA, 2019) to almost 2150 GW in 2050. This represents nearly
                a quarter of China’s total land-based wind potential, which is estimated at around 8 800 GW considering an average
                wind turbine height of 80 metres. In particular,
                China’s northern regions have abundant onshore wind potential. The provinces of Qinghai, Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia,
                and the country’s north east, have the highest power density (average values between 400 and 600 watts per square metre (W/m2)).
                </br>
                </br>
                The onshore wind installed capacity in the 3.5 million km2  of land excluding protected areas, <strong>US</strong>
                would grow from 94 GW in 2018 to almost cities and water This massive potential is mostly 857 GW by 2050 (figure \ref{fig:wind_onshore_america}).
                According to the National concentrated in a central area of the country Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL),
                the total land-based wind potential in the country is more than 10 000 GW, equivalent to almost 3.5
                million  km2  of land excluding protected areas, cities and water This massive potential is mostly
                concentrated in a central area of the country from Minnesota/North-Dakota to Texas, which is likely
                to see the most deployment of future in land wind installations (NREL, 2018).
                </br>
                </br>
                After China and the US, <strong>Europe</strong> is the third largest market for onshore wind in the coming three decades.
                The installed onshore capacity is expected to increase more than two-fold by 2050 compared to the 161
                GW installed as of the end of 2018. The region’s total land-based
                wind potential is an estimated 13 900 GW (EEA, 2009). The best sites for onshore installations are in northern
                and central continental Europe as well as in the UK (EEA, 2009).
            </p>

            <h3>Offshore wind</h3>
            <p>
                Moving forward, a prominent shift in deployment would happen in Asian waters (mostly in China, India, Chinese Taipei, the Republic of Korea, Japan,
                Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam) in the next three decades. <strong>Asia</strong> would eventually dominate global
                offshore wind power installations with a total capacity exceeding 100 GW by 2030 and 600 GW by 2050. Within Asia,
                significant offshore wind deployment would occur in China, where the installed capacity would reach around 56 GW
                by 2030 and 382 GW by 2050.
                </br>
                </br>
                China would dominate offshore wind installations, outpacing Europe in less than two decades from now.
                <strong>Europe</strong> would continue to dominate offshore wind installations for a decade or so, with
                total offshore wind capacity growing four-fold to 78 GW by 2030 and more than eleven-fold to 215 GW by 2050,
                compared to 19 GW in 2018. After Asia and Europe, <strong>North America</strong>
                would be another emerging offshore wind market. In the US, offshore wind installed capacity would grow more strongly,
                from less than 1 GW today to almost 23 GW by 2030 and 164 GW by 2050.

                Developments in blade, drivetrain and control technologies, in particular, would enable the development
                of larger, more reliable turbines with higher capacity ratings. Turbine sizes have increased rapidly in
                recent decades and the technological changes make that the turbine size will increase even more in the
                next years (figures: Onshore wind turbines improvement; Offshore wind turbines improvement).

                2. <strong>Floating foundations.</strong>
                </br>
                </br>
                Technological developments in wind turbine foundations are one of the key factors enabling the
                accelerated deployment of offshore wind, permitting access to better wind resources. Turbines are
                now routinely being installed in water depths of up to 40 metres and as far as 80 kilometres from shore.
                These turbines, rooted in the seabed by monopile or jacket foundations, are currently restricted to waters
                less than 60 metres deep. This is a major limitation, as some of the largest potential markets for offshore
                wind, such as Japan and the US, have few shallow-water sites.
                </br>
                </br>
                In such cases, floating foundations may be a better choice. Floating wind farms are one of the most exciting
                developments in ocean energy technologies. Floating foundations offer the offshore wind industry <strong>three important opportunities</strong>:

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        They allow access to sites with water deeper than 60 metres.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        They ease turbine set-up, even for mid-depth conditions (30–50 metres) and may in time offer a lower-cost
                        alternative to fixed foundations.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Floating foundations generally offer environmental benefits compared with fixed-bottom designs due to
                        less-invasive activity on the seabed during installation.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                        <p>
                            Three main designs are under development and have been tested: spar-buoys, spar-submersibles and
                            tension-leg platforms (figure: Offshore wind turbine foundation technologies).
                            </br>
                            </br>
                            The ability of floating offshore wind turbines to unlock areas of deep water close to shore and large population
                            centres, notably in Japan and the US, could greatly expand offshore wind deployment. Floating technologies can
                            also be applied intensively in south-east Asia, Oceania and Northern Europe. Floating foundations therefore
                            are potentially a “game-changing” technology to effectively exploit abundant wind potential in deeper waters
                            and thus are leading the way for rapid future growth in the offshore wind power market.
                            </br>
                            </br>
                            3. <strong>Integrated turbine and foundation installation.</strong>
                            </br>
                            </br>
                            Most offshore installation operations can be eliminated through the development of technologies and
                            processes that enable assembling and precommissioning of wind turbines in a harbour followed by installation
                            of the complete, integrated turbine (including rotor, tower and foundation) in a single operation offshore.
                            </br>
                            </br>
                            Commercialisation is anticipated around 2025, but technology developments would need to continue to meet the needs of
                            larger turbines.

                4. <strong>HVDC technology.</strong>
                </br>
                </br>
                For projects far offshore, high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission is preferable to high-voltage
                alternating current (HVAC) transmission in order to overcome the reactive resistance (capacitance) caused
                by the export cables in a long grid connection (offshore and onshore).
                </br>
                </br>
                Today, HVDC infrastructure is used to connect two points, but it cannot be used to create a
                multi-nodal network. However, commercialisation of HVDC infrastructure for wind farms is under way,
                with point-to-point grid connections used on a few projects in European waters.
                </br>
                </br>
                5. <strong>Optimised power electronics:</strong> Optimising the power inverters reliability and dimensions could reduce turbine
                installation and operation costs.
                </br>
                </br>
                6. <strong>“Smart/Intelligent” wind turbines:</strong> The digital revolution is affecting wind energy with new technologies for
                turbine monitoring and controls.
