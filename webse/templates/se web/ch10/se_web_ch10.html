                        As he have studied in the previous chapters, the use of renewables alongside efficiency improvements provide
                        80% of the required CO2 emissions reductions. However, there are some specific parts in the transport and industry
                        sectors that could be difficult to decarbonize. In those sectors, the role of hydrogen and bioenergy combined with carbon
                        capture will play a crucial role to abate carbon emissions. We study the main carbon capture technologies, and
                        its current and future development. We conclude the chapter analyzing the potential of Norway in the carbon
                        capture industry.

                emissions reductions, an additional 25% of CO2 reductions would come from the <strong>reduced demand</strong> compared
                to the baseline scenario, <strong>efficiency improvements</strong> and <strong>circular economy</strong>. The
                <strong>electrification of transport</strong> and
                <strong>heat applications</strong> would account for 20% of CO2 emissions reductions, while the use of <strong>hydrogen and synthetic
                fuels and feedstocks</strong> would enable 10% of CO2 emissions reductions.
                </br>
                </br>
                However, the scale of the challenge, the relatively limited time available, the legacy of systems built around
                fossil fuel use, and the complexities of some industrial processes mean that even a very aggressive ramping
                up of renewables will not be sufficient to address all emissions. Some fossil fuel use will remain in 2050 and
                some industrial processes will produce CO2 emissions irrespective of the energy source.
                </br>
                </br>
                There is a targeted role, therefore, for a combination of <strong>carbon capture and storage (CCS)</strong> processes that
                reduce emissions released into the atmosphere, for <strong>carbon capture and utilisation (CCU)</strong> processes that might
                reduce emissions, and for <strong>carbon dioxide removal (CDR)</strong> processes which, combined with long-term storage,
                can remove CO2 from the atmosphere, resulting in negative emissions.

                        <li><strong>Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS)</strong> refers to processes that directly capture CO2 emissions from “point
                        sources” – i.e. from fossil-fuel use or industrial processes with the CO2 subsequently stored in ways that lock
                        it away for long periods. If effectively implemented, the process reduces most of the CO2 emissions being
                        released into the atmosphere, although usually not all.</li>
                        </br>
                        <li><strong>Carbon Capture and Utilisation (CCU)</strong> refers to processes that directly capture CO2 emissions from “point
                        sources” – i.e. from fossil-fuel use or industrial processes – but then utilise that CO2 in secondary processes
                        such as producing synthetic fuels, chemicals and materials. As with CCS, if effectively implemented, CCU
                        reduces some CO2 emissions being immediately released into the atmosphere but, depending on the life-cycle
                        of the products produced, some or all of the utilised CO2 may be subsequently released into the atmosphere.
                        The impact of CCU on emissions is complex therefore and must be carefully managed.</li>
                        </br>
                        <li><strong>Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR)</strong> refers to processes that actually “remove” CO2 from the atmosphere rather
                        than simply reduce what is added. If combined with long-term storage, these can result in negative emissions.
                        These technologies and practices are sometimes therefore called negative emissions technologies (NETs) and
                        include natural approaches such as afforestation or reforestation and technological or engineered approaches
                        such as the use of bioenergy coupled with CCS (BECCS) or direct air capture and storage (DACCS).</li>

                        When growing, biomass captures CO2 from the

                        biomass (or fuels derived from the biomass) is
                        combusted, releasing CO2. In BECCS the majority of
                        that CO2 is captured and then stored. BECCS applies the
                        same technology as CCS with the difference that it uses

                        of CO2 in ambient air requires a higher surface area
                        of solvents or sorbents in their liquid or solid form in

            <h2>The current status of carbon capture, transportation, utilisation and storage</h2>
            <p>
                As of early 2021, <strong>24 commercial fossil fuel-based CCS and CCU facilities</strong> were in operation globally with an
                installed capacity to capture around 0.04 Gtpa of energy- and process-related CO2 emissions.
            </p>

                <div>
                    Of these <strong>CCS and CCU facilities</strong>, 11 are <strong>natural gas processing plants</strong> (where CO2 needs to be removed anyway
                    to produce natural gas that meets specific standards) and one is a<strong> coal-fired power plant</strong>. <strong>Chemical plants</strong>
                    (mostly for ethanol production), <strong>hydrogen production in refineries</strong>, and <strong>iron and steel plants</strong> account for the
                    remainder. Three plants were operational but are now closed or suspended. An additional 30 plants are at
                    various stages of development. A further 16 small scale pilot and demonstration plants are operating, 19 are
                    at various stages of development, and 24 have been completed and closed (Figure: Share of commercial CCS, DACCS and BECCS).
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    If all 30 commercial plants under development are completed, the capture capacity would rise to approximately
                    0.1 Gtpa.

                There are currently three operational commercial facilities that use <strong>bioenergy with CCS (BECCS)</strong> and seven
                commercial plants are in development. The current capture capacity of operational commercial BECCS plants
                is very small at 1.13 Mtpa, which would rise to 9.7 Mtpa if all plants under development reach operation. A
                further nine smaller scale BECCS pilot and demonstration plants are operational – six completed and four in
                different stages of development.
                </br>
                </br>
                There are currently <strong>two facilities that use DACCS</strong>, with one in development, plus 15 pilot and demonstration
                plants in operation or development; however, collectively their capture capacities are quite small.

            <h3>Costs are uncertain and vary by application</h3>

            <p>
                The costs of CCS, CCU and CDR will be a crucial factor in decisions on their future roles; however, <strong>cost
                estimates vary widely</strong>, with <strong>future projections having a high degree of uncertainty</strong>.
                </br>
                </br>
                CCS is capital intensive and, in some cases, has significant operating costs. In general, <strong>capture costs</strong> dominate
                but in some cases <strong>CO2 transportation costs</strong> can be significant. Actual costs are site specific and differ
                significantly depending on the technology used. Capture costs are mainly dependent on CO2 concentration
                and pressure, and transport cost on volume and distance.
                </br>
                </br>
                While the costs of capture in CCU are fairly well understood, the <strong>costs of converting CO2 into products</strong> such
                as fuel, fertilisers, building materials, etc. are less clear and require further research and analysis. The <strong>costs of
                CDR</strong>, and particularly BECCS, depend on biomass feedstock, while the costs of DACCS as a novel technology
                are currently very high with an uncertain cost reduction trajectory.
                </br>
                </br>
                Many cost estimates focus only on capture costs and either do not include costs for compression/liquefaction,
                transportation and storage (including assessment and monitoring costs) or treat transport and storage as
                lump sums.
                </br>
                </br>
                Cost estimates tend to focus on large-scale CCS facilities with large CO2 volumes (such as gas plants) that can
                justify dedicated transport and storage infrastructure, rather than smaller industrial plants that emit lower CO2
                volumes per year (such as cement plants) and will therefore have to rely on clusters, hubs and transportation
                networks to benefit from economies of scale. The same applies to CDR facilities. The calculated costs in
                feasibility studies also tend to be much lower than the costs of actual projects that have been implemented.

                </br>
                When discussing and comparing costs, therefore, the project specifics and the full end-to-end project costs
                need to be considered.
                </br>
                </br>
                As CCS applied to fossil fuel processes results in additional energy use, it can in turn lead to additional CO2
                emissions and the difference can range from 10 to 25%. To account for that, cost per tonne of CO2 avoided (and
                not cost per tonne of CO2 captured) is the best measure to compare CCS with renewable options.
            </p>

            <h3>Transportation costs</h3>

            <p>
                Transporting relatively small quantities of CO2 is an established process and there are a few larger projects,
                mostly located in the US, which involve the pipeline transportation of CO2 for enhanced oil recovery (CO2-
                EOR) or EU regional transport by ships.
                </br>
                </br>
                With experience of transporting other more volatile gasses, the safe transportation of CO2 is not likely
                to be barrier to CCS uptake, although public acceptance may remain a concern, particularly for onshore
                transportation options.
                </br>
                </br>
                There is a lack of detailed data on costs. Transport and storage costs are often modelled in the integrated
                assessment models as lump sums at USD 10/tCO2 and disregard the flowrate, distance to storage and
                utilisation sites, transport mode and storage type, as well as the variability in geographical, geological and
                institutional settings. The models also focus mostly on large-scale plants with high volumes of CO2. There are
                a few more detailed studies that focus on a handful of countries with established infrastructures.
                </br>
                </br>
                Based on current estimates, for pipelines the capital expenditure (CAPEX) is the major component amounting
                up to 90% of total transport costs. For transporting CO2 by ship, the situation reverses and the major
                component is operating costs (OPEX) for liquefaction, fuels, loading/unloading and temporary storage.

                        Based on current estimated costs for capacities of 2.5 to 20 Mtpa CO2 for distances between 180 km
                        and 500 km, onshore pipeline has the lowest costs at USD 1.7–6.1/tCO2, followed by offshore pipelines at
                        USD 3.5‑32.4/tCO2. Transport via offshore pipelines up to 1 500 km entails costs of up to USD 58.4/tCO2.
                        Shipping ranges from USD 12.5-22.4/tCO2 for distances between 180 km to 1 500 km.

            <h3>Geological storage of CO2</h3>

            <p>
                Permanent geological storage options include saline formations and depleted oil and gas fields. Other storage
                options relate to enhanced hydrocarbons – <strong>particularly enhanced oil recovery (EOR)</strong>. Geological storage
                in saline formations and in EOR has been carried out at Mtpa scale in past decades, but there is not yet
                experience in storing CO2 at Gtpa scale, as the CO2 captured has not yet reached Gtpa scale.
            </p>

            <!--Text-Image-->
            <div class="text_image_css">
                <div>
                    The largest experience in storing CO2 is in EOR, which has a very low risk of CO2 leakage. For CO2 pumped
                    underground into geological formations, researchers expect less than 0.0008% of stored CO2 to be leaked
                    over 10 000 years. While the risks of leakage are small, public perceptions towards this
                    approach may still become an issue. Monitoring and verification processes will be important, and must be a
                    mandated and –ideally – a regulated part of any storage project.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    There is more than <strong>12 000 Gt of potential</strong>, albeit mostly unverified, of CO2 storage resources in saline
                    formations globally, out of which 400 Gt of storage is currently well documented; but there are only a small
                    number of large-scale commercial projects. There are currently six projects storing almost
                    0.009 Gtpa of CO2 in the United States, Canada, Algeria and Norway.

                        estimates for depleted onshore oil and gas fields in the EU range from USD 1.2‑3.8/tCO2, with offshore at
                        USD 3.8–8.1/tCO2. These cost ranges come with many caveats; in particular, lower ranges look optimistic and
                        it is unclear how much they include the costs of monitoring, verification or pressurisation.

            <h2>The future role of CCS, CCU and CDR</h2>
            <p>
                Low-cost renewables make carbon capture combined with fossil
                fuel use unnecessary in many sectors and contexts, but it will be
                needed in some applications (Figure: The role of CCS, CCU and BECCS across sectors).

                <div>
                    Renewables and CCS (applied to fossil fuel use and/or process emissions) are often perceived as competitors
                    in the energy transition but in some applications they can be partners and, in a few cases, CCS is the only
                    option.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    The respective roles of renewables versus CCS vary by country, sector and the specific contexts of each
                    deployment. <strong>Factors of importance</strong> include: relative costs; practicality of deployment; availability of supporting
                    transport and storage infrastructure; actual emission abatement potential; deployment time scales; skills and
                    knowledge; social impacts; and societal attitudes.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    In <strong>most contexts in the power sector, renewables outcompete CCS</strong> on cost per tonne of CO2 and sustainability
                    grounds.

                    In IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, the use of CCS and CCU for fossil fuel or process emissions is limited to the most
                    essential applications – in particular to capturing process emissions in hydrogen, cement, iron and steel and
                    chemical production with a limited deployment for industry/waste incinerators, etc. CCS is not deployed for
                    fossil-fuel based power production.

                    </br>
                    In the 1.5°C Scenario, CCS and CCU for fossil fuel or process emissions from power, fuel production and
                    industrial process rises from 0.04 Gtpa today to 2.8 Gtpa of CO2 in 2040 and 3.4 Gtpa of CO2 in 2050,
                    cumulatively capturing 58 Gt globally over that period.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    These figures include 2.4 Gtpa in 2050 from CCS applied in the <strong>cement, chemical and steel sectors</strong>, and
                    1.1 Gtpa in 2050 captured in the <strong>production of blue hydrogen</strong> from natural gas with CCS, which accounts for
                    c. 30% of total hydrogen supply.

                            Bioenergy with CCS (BECCS) is essential for the net-zero goal but
                            needs to reach <strong>4.5 Gtpa by 2050</strong> and faces multiple challenges (Figure: The role of CCS, CCU and BECCS across sectors).

                CDR processes, combined with long-term storage, can in principle remove CO2 from the atmosphere, resulting
                in negative emissions. CDR technologies are therefore a critical component of net-zero pathways.
                </br>
                </br>
                CDR measures and technologies can include nature-based processes such as reforestation, as well as
                technology or engineered approaches such as BECCS, DACCS and some other experimental approaches.
                </br>
                </br>
                The most developed example of CDR technology is BECCS. <strong>Biomass absorbs CO2 from the atmosphere as
                it grows</strong>, and the use of CCS prevents most of that CO2 from going back to the atmosphere during biomass
                final use. The overall result is that CO2 is effectively removed from the atmosphere through biomass growth
                and storage elsewhere.
                </br>
                </br>
                Net-zero pathways rely on BECCS but it is currently unproven in most contexts and there are complexities to
                be addressed. The extensive use of BECCS requires both a scaling up of CCS deployment and strategies to
                ensure sufficient suitable and sustainable biomass feedstock supplies.
                </br>
                </br>
                <strong>There are a range of potential applications of BECCS</strong>, including: power and heat generation with biomass
                providing some or all of the fuel (e.g. wood pellets, sugarcane or municipal solid waste); cement kilns
                with biomass providing the fuel; blast furnaces for iron production, where charcoal can be used as a fuel and
                reducing agent; chemical plants where the chemical feedstock is biomass (e.g. bio-methanol or in bioethanol
                production); and biogas upgrading where the CO2 fraction of biogas is separated for the production of
                biomethane.

                    Depending on the plant design, biomass can be the only fuel, or it can be co-fired with coal or natural gas. In
                    the past decade, a small number of coal power plants have been converted into 100% biomass power plants
                    or are in the process of doing so. However, the number of such conversions to date is small and only one fully
                    converted power plant has a clear publicly announced plan to add CCS; as yet, no co-firing coal or natural gas
                    power plants have announced plans to add CCS.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    In IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, BECCS use results in 2.7 Gtpa of CO2 captured and stored in 2040, and 4.5 Gtpa of CO2
                    in 2050 (Figure: The role of CCS, CCU and BECCS across sectors). This includes the carbon balance in the chemical and petrochemical industry through
                    carbon stocks in chemical products, recycling and carbon capture in waste incineration. As a result, towards
                    2050 the power and industry sectors become net negative; i.e. the CO2 captured more than compensates for
                    remaining CO2 emissions in those sectors. To capture 4.5 Gtpa of CO2 by 2050 would require investments of
                    more than USD 1.1 trillion between 2021 and 2050.

            <p>
                BECCS can, in principle, be utilised in a range of processes but the optimum application of BECCS requires
                more detailed investigation of costs, logistics and sustainable biomass supply chains, and will be highly
                country and context specific. IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario includes biomass-based processes from which 10.12 Gtpa
                could be captured and stored by 2050 (Figure: Potential for biogenic carbon capture in 2050). Of that potential, the scenario assumes 44% (4.5Gtpa)
                is actually captured and stored but is not specific about where BECCS would be applied. <strong>The most significant
                opportunities are in power, heat, chemicals and biorefineries</strong> but BECCS <strong>could also be significant in cement,
                pulp and paper, and food production</strong>. The potential in iron and steel production is low in the 1.5°C Scenario
                by 2050, since the scenario assumes a nearly complete transition away from blast furnaces by then, but the
                BECCS potential could be larger there during the transition or if more blast furnaces utilising biomass and
                CCS are retained.

                <p>
                    To illustrate the scale of BECCS required, the Drax power plant in the UK has converted four coal-fired units
                    (each rated at c. 660 MW) to biomass and is planning to retrofit CCS to at least two units. Each
                    individual unit would capture circa 4 Mtpa. Capturing 4.5 Gtpa would require over 1 100 such units around the
                    world, or an equivalent, and most BECCS applications will be much smaller than this.

            <h3>Other CDR technologies</h3>

            <p>
                Other CDR technologies include DACCS and some other approaches that are mostly at an early experimental
                stage, which makes their future potential hard to quantify. According to this early experience, projects face
                high energy and land requirements, but offer flexibility in terms of their location.
                </br>
                </br>
                DACCS is another CDR technology that is in the early stages of development and a long way from reaching the
                gigatonne-scales needed to be impactful. There are two commercial plants currently operating and capturing
                a negligible amount of CO2 (0.0009 Mtpa, 0.9 ktpa), and one other plant is under development and would
                add an additional 0.021 Mtpa (21 ktpa) of CO2 capture. In addition, there are 15 pilot and demonstration plants
                – three completed, seven in operation and five at various stages of development.
                </br>
                </br>
                These technologies do not currently play a major role in the IRENA 1.5°C Scenario. However, countries and
                investors are beginning to make financial commitments to large-scale DACCS projects, which – if successful
                in driving scale – would allow DACCS to offset some of the need for BECCS or could allow for more emissions
                elsewhere.

            <p>
                Norway has the knowledge and many years of experience with CCS, not only in CCS technology such as CO2 monitoring
                and storage but in essential related sectors such as geology, offshore engineering and industrial processes.
                </br>
                </br>
                With a large, natural geological CO2 storage capacity area under the North Sea and more than 20 years of experience with CO2
                storage, Norway is in a strong position to demonstrate CCS at scale.
                </br>
                </br>
                The Government proposes September 21, 2021 to launch a carbon capture and storage (CCS) project in Norway.
                The project has been named ‘Longship’, in Norwegian ‘Langskip’.
                </br>
                </br>
                Longship seeks to fulfill the objectives of both Government and industry by reducing investment barriers for
                business and developing sustainable value creation opportunities.

                  <p class="text-right">
                      Since the world has agreed on ambitious climate targets and there is a growing consensus among international bodies that
                      CCS is needed to achieve them, why has CCS not already taken off?
                      </br>
                      </br>
                      To date there has been a lack of investment in CCS projects. The very same IEA, UN and EU reports
                      which extol the virtues of CCS have also been quick to point this out.
                      </br>
                      </br>
                      This lack of commercialization has primarily been driven by several CCS specific market failures.
                      So there is an obvious need for cooperation between the private and the public sectors to overcome market
                      hurdles to increase investment in CCS.
                      </br>
                      </br>
                      How then, do we unlock this investment? The key lies in demonstrating CCS to prove that it is viable,
                      building open-access CO2 infrastructure and developing public-private cooperation.

                  <p class="text-right">
                      CCS has been proven to be technically viable in several existing projects around the world. Globally,
                      there are large-scale CCUS projects already in operation, such as Equinor’s Sleipner project, SaskPower’s
                      Boundary Dam project and Shell’s Quest project.
                      </br>
                      </br>
                      All of these projects are incredibly useful and Longship will be building on the lessons that have
                      been learned and shared as CCS technology has developed over the years. In addition, the Longship
                      aims to address more of the market failures which have so far held up investment in CCS as a broad
                      climate mitigation tool. Longship aims to do this by:
                      </br>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Demonstrating the full CCS chain.</li>
                        </br>
                        <li>Establishing an open access transport and storage infrastructure.</li>
                        </br>
                        <li>Capturing CO2 from a cement factory and potentially from a Waste to Energy (WtE) plant.</li>
                        </br>
                        <li>Testing CCS under the condition of relevant EU regulation.</li>
                      </ul>
                      </br>
                      Longship is also driven by public-private cooperation with a shared responsibility for investment.
                      Each industrial partner is responsible for designing their own project, while the state coordinates
                      and creates a framework for each partner’s role.

                In a Government White Paper to the Norwegian parliament submitted 21/09/2020, the Government proposes to
                launch a carbon capture and storage (CCS) project in Norway. The project has been named ‘Longship’,
                in Norwegian 'Langskip'.
                </br>
                </br>
                Longship is a milestone in the Government’s industry and climate efforts. The project will lead to
                emission cuts, and facilitate development of new technology and thus new jobs.

                              The Government proposes to first implement carbon capture at Norcem’s cement factory in Brevik.
                              In addition, the Government also intends to fund Fortum Oslo Varme’s waste incineration facility in Oslo,
                              providing that the project secures sufficient own funding as well as funding from the EU or other sources
                              (Figure: CSS projects in Norway).

                              For Longship to be a successful climate project for the future, other countries also have to start using this

                              Shell and Total. Northern Lights will transport liquid CO2 from capture facilities to a terminal at
                              Øygarden in Vestland County. From there, CO2 will be pumped through pipelines to a reservoir beneath the

                  <p class="text-right">
                      For many years, various Norwegian governments have supported technology development, test and pilot
                      projects, and underscored the importance of carbon capture and storage as an important climate tool
                      internationally. The present Government has followed up this work and made targeted efforts on CCS since 2013.
                      </br>
                      </br>
                      According to the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, CCS will be necessary to reduce global
                      greenhouse gas emissions in line with the climate targets at the lowest possible cost. There are
                      currently few facilities in operation on a global basis. We therefore need more projects that bring
                      learning and technological development. In turn, they will help  reduce costs. If CCS is to become an
                      efficient climate policy instrument, new facilities must be established in Europe and globally.

                  <p class="text-right">
                      Norway has committed itself to cutting domestic emissions by 50-55 precent by 2030.
                      </br>
                      </br>
                      For the world to achieve the goals that we have committed ourselves to in the Paris Agreement,
                      we need large-scale carbon capture and storage. Not all emissions can be cut by applying renewable energy.
                      In several industrial processes, such as production of cement, CCS is the only technology that can cut emissions.
                      With Longship, Norway will support development of climate solutions for the future.
                      </br>
                      </br>
                      Norway is in a good position to contribute to the development of CCS. The country has a strong
                      technological community in the field of carbon capture, transport and storage. For decades, the
                      development and operation of the CO2 storage projects on the Sleipner and Snøhvit fields have demonstrated
                      safe carbon storage on the Norwegian continental shelf.
                      </br>
                      </br>
                      Effective climate policies must be positive industrial policies. Through Longship, the Government
                      will strengthen Norwegian industry by enabling enterprises to meet the climate requirements of the
                      future. The project is an important contribution to green growth and will secure and create new
                      jobs in the industry.
                      </br>
                      </br>
                      Longship facilitates the further development of CCS both in Norway and Europe. The project has
                      been matured to a level required for an investment decision, and the decision basis shows that
                      all parts of the project are feasible.
                      </br>
                      </br>
                      The project also involves risks. For Longship to have the desired effect, an ambitious development
                      of climate policies in Europe is needed.  The risks are primarily connected to the economy of the
                      project, such as the technical integration of the different parts of the project, the scope of
                      following projects and necessary support schemes for such projects from the EU and individual
                      countries. What is not at risk is the safety and integrity of the storage solution for CO2.

                    transport and storage infrastructure that provides capacity above and beyond that required for
                    the <strong>Norcem</strong> and <strong>Fortum</strong> capture sites.

                    As a part of the Longship CCS project, we share the experience from previous and ongoing CCS projects
                    like Northern Lights. By increasing the knowledge of CCS technologies, we aim to speed up the development and
                    demonstrate that carbon capture and storage can be executed at large scale.

                    </br>
                    The Northern Lights project is developing a CCS technology where the CO2 will be stored in pressurized
                    tanks before being pumped offshore through a pipeline to one or more injection wells that are located on the seafloor.
                    No offshore platform is required for these wells and they will be controlled using existing oil and gas
                    infrastructure on the Norwegian continental shelf. Much of the design and operations of these facilities
                    is similar to the ones used for liquid petroleum gas (LPG), with the exception of the fire hazard, which is
                    absent for CO2.

                      Given the ambition to transport CO2 from across the European Continent, the receiving terminal
                      has been designed with future expansion in mind. The number of pressure tanks can be increased
                      and there is even an option for building a second jetty to be able to receive two tankers at a
                      time. The pipeline from the receiving terminal can transport the volumes of CO2 required and
                      additional wells can be connected to the end of the pipeline.

                  <p class="text-right">
                      Equinor was awarded a permit to develop the CO2 storage site on behalf of the Northern Lights 
                      consortium in January 2019. The acreage lies to the south of the giant Troll hydrocarbon field, 
                      west of Bergen, and represents a prime location for the geological storage of CO2 deep below 
                      the seafloor.
                      </br>
                      </br>
                      Northern Lights drilled a well to confirm the properties of the storage reservoir in Q1 2020 
                      and this will also serve as the injector well once CO2 starts flowing from the capture plants 
                      when the project begins.
                      </br>
                      </br>  
                      However, before injection of CO2 can commence, the Northern Lights consortium will also need to 
                      obtain a CO2 Storage permit from the Environmental Protection Agency, which has a mandate to 
                      protect the natural environment on the seafloor and in the sea itself.
                      </br>
                      </br>  
                      In order to adhere to the regulations that come with these permits, Equinor and their partners 
                      will put in place a robust monitoring system, similar to the ones they have used for many years 
                      at the Sleipner and Snøhvit storage fields.

            <p>
                Fortum Oslo Varme’s <strong>Waste-to-energy plant</strong> at Klemetsrud on the outskirts of Oslo, Norway’s capital
                could be the world's first of its kind with full-scale carbon capture. The plant will be able to capture 
                400,000 tonnes of CO2 a year, and provide transfer opportunities to other industrial plants in the Nordic 
                region and Europe. Fortum Oslo Varme's CCS project shows how cities across Europe best possibly can handle 
                waste that should not or cannot be recycled. The excess heat from the end treatment of residual waste is 
                used to produce electricity, district heating and soon cooling to the city of Oslo.
                </br>
                </br>
                The flue gas from the end treatment of waste is currently cleaned of dioxins, NOX and CO. Now Fortum wants 
                to capture the CO2. A 5500 hour pilot in 2019 demonstrated the possibility to capturing<strong> more than 
                90% of all CO2 in the flue gas</strong>. Estimately 50% of the waste incinerated at the plant is of
                biological origin such as non-recyclable food scraps, paper and wood, making the plant carbon-negative. 
                When capturing CO2 from biological origin, it means that CO2 is taken out of the atmosphere. 
                This is also known as bio-CCS, or BECCS, something that both the European Commission, the UN and the 
                International Energy Agency all emphasize is of the utmost importance for achieving the world's climate goals.
                </br>
                </br>
                The City of Oslo has ambitious climate targets and needs CO2 capture at the waste-to-energy plant to 
                reach its goal. The carbon capture project is also strongly rooted in Fortum’s strategy to build a 
                cleaner world.
