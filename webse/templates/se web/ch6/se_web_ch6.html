                        In the last decade the cost of solar has dropped substantially, and solar energy production is growing
                        substantially. In this chapter, we study the history of solar energy, and the different solar energy production
                        technologies. We continue studying the solar panels, solar cells efficiency and solar panels at home. We conclude
                        the chapter by studying the main trends in solar energy production.

            <h3>Introduction</h3>

            <p>
                Solar energy is radiant light and heat from the sun that is harnessed using a range of ever-evolving
                technologies such as <strong>solar heating</strong>, <strong>photovoltaics</strong>, <strong>solar thermal energy</strong>,
                <strong>solar architecture</strong>, <strong>molten salt power plants</strong> and <strong>artificial photosynthesis</strong>.
                </br>
                </br>
                It is an essential source of renewable energy, and its technologies are broadly characterized as either
                <strong>passive solar</strong> or <strong>active solar</strong> depending on how they capture and distribute solar energy
                or convert it into solar power.

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Active solar</strong> techniques include the use of photovoltaic systems, concentrated solar power, and solar water heating to harness the energy.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Passive solar</strong> techniques include orienting a building to the Sun, selecting materials with
                        favorable thermal mass or light-dispersing properties, and designing spaces that naturally circulate air.
                    </li>
                </ul>            
            </p>

            <h3>History</h3>      
            
            <p>
                In 1878, at the Universal Exposition in Paris, Augustin Mouchot successfully demonstrated a 
                <strong>solar steam engine</strong>, but couldn't continue development because of cheap coal and other factors.
                </br>
                </br>
                In 1897, Frank Shuman, a US inventor, engineer and solar energy pioneer built a small demonstration 
                solar engine that worked by reflecting solar energy onto square boxes filled with <strong>ether</strong>,
                which has a lower boiling point than water and were fitted internally with black pipes which in turn 
                powered a steam engine. In 1908 Shuman formed the Sun Power Company with the intent of building larger 
                solar power plants. He, along with his technical advisor A.S.E. Ackermann and British physicist Sir Charles 
                Vernon Boys, developed an improved system using mirrors to reflect solar energy upon collector boxes, 
                increasing heating capacity to the extent that water could now be used instead of ether. Shuman then 
                constructed a full-scale steam engine powered by <strong>low-pressure water</strong>, enabling him to patent
                the entire solar engine system by 1912.
                </br>
                </br>
                Shuman built the world's first solar thermal power station in Maadi, Egypt, between 1912 and 1913. 
                His plant used parabolic troughs to power a 45–52 kilowatts engine that pumped more than 22,000 litres
                of water per minute from the Nile River to adjacent cotton fields. Although the outbreak of World War I
                and the discovery of cheap oil in the 1930s discouraged the advancement of solar energy, Shuman's vision, 
                and basic design were resurrected in the 1970s with a new wave of interest in solar thermal energy.

                The Earth receives 174 petawatts (PW) of incoming solar radiation (insolation) at the upper atmosphere.
                Approximately  30%  is reflected back to space while the rest is absorbed by clouds, oceans and land masses. 
                The spectrum of solar light at the Earth's surface is mostly spread across the visible and near-infrared ranges 
                with a small part in the near-ultraviolet. Most of the world's population live in areas with <strong>insolation levels</strong>
                of 150–300 watts/m2, or 3.5–7.0 kWh/m2 per day.
                </br>
                </br>
                The total solar energy absorbed by Earth's atmosphere, oceans and land masses is approximately 3,850,000 exajoules (EJ) 
                per year. This is more energy in <strong>one hour</strong> than the world used in one year.
                </br>
                </br>
                Photosynthesis captures approximately 3,000 EJ per year in biomass. The amount of solar energy reaching 
                the surface of the planet is so vast that in <strong>one year</strong> it is about twice as much as will ever be
                obtained from all of the Earth's non-renewable resources of coal, oil, natural gas, and mined uranium combined.
                </br>
                </br>
                The potential solar energy that could be used by humans differs from the amount of solar energy present near 
                the surface of the planet because factors such as geography, time variation, cloud cover, and the land available 
                to humans limit the amount of solar energy that we can acquire.

                      A solar thermal collector collects heat by absorbing sunlight. The term "solar collector" commonly
                      refers to a device for solar <strong>hot water heating</strong>, but may refer to large power generating
                      installations such as solar parabolic troughs and solar towers or non water heating devices such as
                      solar air heaters.
                      </br>
                      </br>
                      Solar thermal collectors are either <strong>non-concentrating</strong> or <strong>concentrating</strong>.

                        <li>
                            In <strong>non-concentrating collectors</strong>, the aperture area (i.e., the area that receives the solar radiation)
                            is roughly the same as the absorber area (i.e., the area absorbing the radiation). A common example of such
                            a system is a metal plate that is painted a dark color to maximize the absorption of sunlight. The energy is
                            then collected by cooling the plate with a working fluid, often water or glycol running in pipes
                            attached to the plate (right-hand side, figure: Solar thermal collectors).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Concentrating collectors</strong> have a much larger aperture than the absorber area. The aperture
                            is typically in the form of a mirror that is focussed on the absorber, which in most cases are
                            the pipes carrying the working fluid. Due to the movement of the sun during the day, concentrating
                            collectors often require some form of solar tracking system, and are sometimes referred to "active"
                            collectors for this reason (left-hand side, figure: Solar thermal collectors).

                      <strong>Non-concentrating collectors</strong> are typically used in residential and commercial buildings for space heating,
                      while <strong>concentrating collectors</strong> in concentrated solar power plants generate electricity by heating a
                      heat-transfer fluid to drive a turbine connected to an electrical generator.

                      The photovoltaic effect is commercially utilized for electricity generation and as photosensors.

                      A photovoltaic system employs solar modules, each comprising a number of solar cells, which generate
                      electrical power. PV installations may be ground-mounted, rooftop mounted, wall mounted or floating.

                     Solar thermal energy (STE) is a form of energy and a technology for harnessing solar energy to generate
                      thermal energy for use in industry, and in the residential and commercial sectors.
                      </br>
                      </br>
                      Solar thermal collectors are classified by the United States Energy Information Administration
                      as low-, medium-, or high-temperature collectors. Low-temperature collectors are generally
                      unglazed and used to heat swimming pools or to heat ventilation air. Medium-temperature
                      collectors are also usually flat plates but are used for heating water or air for residential
                      and commercial use.
                      </br>
                      </br>
                      High-temperature collectors concentrate sunlight using mirrors or lenses and are generally used for
                      fulfilling heat requirements up to 300 deg C / 20 bar pressure in industries, and for electric power
                      production. Two categories include Concentrated Solar Thermal (CST) for fulfilling heat requirements
                      in industries, and Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) when the heat collected is used for power generation
                      (figure: Concentrated Solar Power).

                      Solar architecture is an architectural approach that takes in account the Sun to harness clean and
                      renewable solar power. It is related to the fields of optics, thermics, electronics and materials science.
                      Both active and passive solar housing skills are involved in solar architecture.

                      The use of flexible thin-film photovoltaic modules provides fluid integration with steel roofing profiles,
                      enhancing the building's design. Orienting a building to the Sun, selecting materials with favorable thermal
                      mass or light dispersing properties, and designing spaces that naturally circulate air also constitute solar
                      architecture.

                      </br>
                      Initial development of solar architecture has been limited by the rigidity and weight of standard solar power panels.
                      The continued development of photovoltaic (PV) thin film solar has provided a lightweight yet robust
                      vehicle to harness solar energy to reduce a building's impact on the environment.

            <h3>Voltage (volts), current (amps), resistance (ohms).</h3>
            <p>
                The <strong>three most basic units in electricity</strong> are <strong>voltage</strong> (V), <strong>current</strong> (I) and
                <strong>resistance</strong> (R). Voltage is measured in volts, current is measured in amps and resistance is measured in ohms.
                </br>
                </br>
                A neat analogy to help understand these terms is a system of <strong>plumbing pipes</strong>.
                
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The <strong>voltage</strong> is equivalent to the <strong>water pressure</strong>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The <strong>current</strong> is equivalent to the <strong>flow rate</strong>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The <strong>resistance</strong> is like the <strong>pipe size</strong>.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                There is a basic <strong>equation</strong> in electrical engineering that states how the three terms relate.
                It says that the current is equal to the voltage divided by the resistance or I = V/R. This is known as Ohm's law.
                </br>
                </br>
                Let's see how this relation applies to the plumbing system. Let's say you have a tank of pressurized water connected 
                to a hose that you are using to water the garden.
                </br>
                </br>
                <u>Analogy 1:</u> What happens if you increase the pressure in the tank? You probably can guess that this makes
                more water come out of the hose. The same is true of an electrical system: <strong>Increasing the voltage will make more current flow</strong>.
                </br>
                </br>
                <u>Analogy 2:</u> Let's say you increase the diameter of the hose and all of the fittings to the tank.
                You probably guessed that this also makes more water come out of the hose. This is like decreasing the 
                resistance in an electrical system, which increases the current flow.
            </p>
            <h3>Power (watts).</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Electrical power</strong> is measured in <strong>watts</strong>. In an electrical system power (P) is equal
                to the voltage multiplied by the current (P=V*I).
                </br>
                </br>
                The water analogy still applies. Take a hose and point it at a waterwheel like the ones that were used to
                turn grinding stones in watermills. You can increase the power generated by the waterwheel in two ways.
                If you increase the pressure of the water coming out of the hose, it hits the waterwheel with a lot more
                force and the wheel turns faster, generating more power. If you increase the flow rate, the waterwheel turns
                faster because of the weight of the extra water hitting it.
            </p>
            <h3>Transmission losses.</h3>
            <br>
                It is very useful to know the losses of a transmission line or any other appliance.
                Those losses depend on the amount of power that circulate through, the voltage, the current
                and the resistance.
                </br>
                </br>
                The relation between the power that circulate through the grid (P), the current (I) and the
                voltage (V) is determined by I=P/V.
                </br>
                </br>
                The relation between the power transmission losses is defined by:

                It is very interesting to analyze the relation between voltage and power transmission losses.
                By taken working out the partial derivative of the power transmission losses respect the voltage,
                we obtain:

                The previous equations determines that when the voltage increases,
                the transmission power losses decreases substantially. The same basic equation determine power
                losses in other electronic appliances. To illustrate the analysis, we solve the next two examples.
                </br>
                </br>
                <u>Example 1:</u> A power station generates power at 100 KW. It sends this power to a town several
                kilometres away through transmission lines that have a total resistance of 0.40 Ohms.
                If the power is transmitted at <strong>300 Volts</strong>, calculate:

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        The current in the transmission lines.

                It is important to notice that by doubling the voltage, the proportion of losses has decreases more than
                double passing from 0.44 to 0.11. This the reason because voltage is so important, since by increasing the
                voltage, the transmission losses can decrease substantially.

            <h2>Solar Panels</h2>
            <h3>History solar cells</h3>
            <p>
                In <strong>1839</strong>, the ability of some materials to create an electrical charge from light exposure was
                first observed by Alexandre-Edmond Becquerel. Though the premiere solar panels were too inefficient for 
                even simple electric devices they were used as an instrument to measure light. The observation by 
                Becquerel was not replicated again until <strong>1873</strong>, when Willoughby Smith discovered that the
                charge could be caused by light hitting selenium. After this discovery, William Grylls Adams and 
                Richard Evans Day published "The action of light on selenium" in <strong>1876</strong>, describing the
                experiment they used to replicate Smith's results.
                </br>
                </br>
                In <strong>1881</strong>, Charles Fritts created the first commercial solar panel, which was reported by
                Fritts as "continuous, constant and of considerable force not only by exposure to sunlight but also 
                to dim, diffused daylight." However, these solar panels were very inefficient, especially compared to 
                coal-fired power plants. In <strong>1939</strong>, Russell Ohl created the solar cell design that is used in
                many modern solar panels. He patented his design in 1941. In <strong>1954</strong>, this design was first
                used by Bell Labs to create the first commercially viable silicon solar cell. In <strong>1957</strong>,
                Mohamed M. Atalla developed the process of silicon surface passivation by thermal oxidation at 
                Bell Labs. The surface passivation process has since been critical to solar cell efficiency.

            <h3>How does solar energy work?</h3>

            <p>
                Photovoltaic modules use light energy (photons) from the Sun to generate electricity through the
                photovoltaic effect. Most modules use wafer-based crystalline silicon cells or thin-film cells.
                The structural (load carrying) member of a module can be either the top layer or the back layer.
                Cells must be protected from mechanical damage and moisture. Most modules are rigid, but semi-flexible
                ones based on thin-film cells are also available. The cells are connected electrically in series, one to
                another to the desired voltage, and then in parallel to increase amperage. The wattage of the module is
                the mathematical product of the voltage and the amperage of the module. The manufacture specifications
                on solar panels are obtained under standard condition which is not the real operating condition the
                solar panels are exposed to on the installation site.
                </br>
                </br>
                A PV junction box is attached to the back of the solar panel and functions as its output interface.
                External connections for most photovoltaic modules use MC4 connectors to facilitate easy weatherproof
                connections to the rest of the system. A USB power interface can also be used.
                </br>
                </br>
                Module electrical connections are made in series to achieve a desired output voltage or in parallel to
                provide a desired current capability (amperes) of the solar panel or the PV system. The conducting wires
                that take the current off the modules are sized according to the ampacity and may contain silver,
                copper or other non-magnetic conductive transition metals.

            <h3>Solar cell efficiency</h3>
            
            <p>
                <strong>Solar cell efficiency</strong> refers to the portion of energy in the form of sunlight that can be
                converted via photovoltaics into electricity by the solar cell.
                </br>
                </br>
                The efficiency of the solar cells used in a photovoltaic system, in combination with latitude and 
                climate, determines the annual energy output of the system. For example, a solar panel with 20%
                efficiency and an area of 1 m2 will produce 200 kWh/yr at Standard Test Conditions if exposed to the 
                Standard Test Condition solar irradiance value of 1000 W/m2 for 2.74 hours a day. Usually solar panels 
                are exposed to sunlight for longer than this in a given day, but the solar irradiance is less than 
                1000 W/m2 for most of the day. A solar panel can produce more when the sun is high in the sky and 
                will produce less in cloudy conditions or when the sun is low in the sky. The sun is lower in the sky 
                in the winter. 
                </br>
                </br>
                In a high yield solar area like central Colorado, which receives annual insolation of 2000 kWh/m2/year, 
                such a panel can be expected to produce 400 kWh of energy per year. However, in Michigan, which receives 
                only 1400 kWh/m2/year, annual energy yield will drop to 280 kWh for the same panel. 
                </br>

                Several factors affect a cell's conversion efficiency value, including its reflectance, 
                thermodynamic efficiency, charge carrier separation efficiency, charge carrier collection efficiency 
                and conduction efficiency values. Because these parameters can be difficult to measure directly, other 
                parameters are measured instead, including <strong>quantum efficiency</strong>,
                <strong>open-circuit voltage (VOC) ratio</strong>, and <strong>fill factor</strong>.
                Reflectance losses are accounted for by the quantum efficiency value, as they affect 
                "external quantum efficiency." Recombination losses are accounted for by the quantum efficiency, 
                VOC ratio, and fill factor values. Resistive losses are predominantly accounted for by the
                fill factor value, but also contribute to the quantum efficiency and VOC ratio values.
                In 2019, the world record for solar cell efficiency at 47.1%  was achieved by using multi-junction
                concentrator solar cells, developed at National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, Colorado, USA. 
                This is above the standard rating of 37.0% for polycrystalline photovoltaic or thin-film solar cells.

                    Open-circuit voltage (VOC) is the difference of electrical potential between two terminals of a device
                    when disconnected from any circuit. There is no external load connected. No external
                    electric current flows between the terminals. Alternatively, the open-circuit voltage may be thought
                    of as the voltage that must be applied to a solar cell or a battery to stop the current. It is sometimes
                    given the symbol VOC. In network analysis this voltage is also known as the Thévenin voltage.

                        In hybrid solar systems, rooftop solar panels are connected to both a solar battery and the electric
                        grid. This reduces your reliance on the utility while also providing backup power when needed. The
                        architecture of an hybrid solar system is represented in figure: Hybrid solar system architecture.
                        In the previous sections we have studied the main features of solar panels. In this section, we study
                        the role of inverters, since they play an important role in hybrid solar systems.
                        </br>
                        </br>
                        Solar inverters are an integral part of every solar power system. They perform two key functions:

                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <strong>DC to AC conversion:</strong> All solar panels generate Direct Current (DC); a solar
                                inverter is required to convert this into Alternating Current (AC), the form of
                                electricity usable by your home.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>MPP tracking:</strong> The operating conditions of solar panels - sunlight intensity and panel
                                temperature - fluctuate throughout the day. This means that the possible solar panel voltage
                                and current are always changing as well. In a process called Maximum Power Point (MPP)
                                tracking, the solar inverter dynamically selects the exact combination of the two that
                                will produce the most power (figure: Maximum Power Point curve).
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                There are two categories to consider when deciding on the right solar inverter type:
                <strong>the solar inverter technology</strong>, and <strong>the type of solar power system the inverter is for</strong>.

                                        <strong>String inverter:</strong> A string inverter is a single, standalone unit that
                                        converts power from a whole string (or strings) of solar panels. 
                                        String inverters are cheap and convenient, but tend to be the least efficient.
		                            </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>String inverter + power optimizer:</strong> Power optimizers are
                                        attached to each individual panel. They perform MPP tracking at the module level; 
                                        the optimized DC power is then sent to the string inverter for conversion into 
                                        AC power. Combining string inverters with power optimizers will increase your 
                                        cost but allow your system to handle issues like shading better.

                                        <strong>Microinverter:</strong> Microinverters are also attached to individual panels.
                                        They perform both MPP tracking and power conversion at the module level, allowing 
                                        each panel to output usable AC power. They’re good at dealing with shade 
                                        (like power optimizers), and have the additional advantage of making your 
                                        solar system easy to expand. They are, however, the most expensive type of inverter.

                                        They manage a two-way relationship with the grid, exporting solar power to it,

                      Accelerated deployment of renewables, combined with deep electrification and increased energy
                      efficiency, can achieve over 90% of the energy-related <strong>carbon dioxide (CO2) emission
                      reductions</strong> needed by 2050 to set the world on an energy pathway towards meeting the Paris climate
                      targets. Among all low-carbon technology options, accelerated deployment of solar PV alone can lead
                      to significant emission reductions of 4.9 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide (Gt CO2) in 2050, representing
                      21% of the total emission mitigation potential in the energy sector.

                       Solar installed capacity must scale up solar PV capacity in next three decades. This entails
                      increasing total solar PV capacity almost sixfold over the next ten years, from a global total of
                      480 GW in 2018 to 2 840 GW by 2030, and to 8 519 GW by 2050 – an increase of almost eighteen times

                      The solar PV industry would need to be prepared for such a significant growth in the market over
                      the next three decades. In annual growth terms, an almost threefold rise in yearly solar PV
                      <strong>capacity additions</strong> is needed by 2030 (to 270 GW per year) and a fourfold rise by 2050
                      (to 372 GW per year), compared to current levels (94 GW added in 2018) (figure: Solar deployment).

                      At a regional level, Asia is expected to drive the wave of solar PV capacity installations, being
                      the world leaders in solar PV energy. Asia (mostly China) would continue to dominate solar PV
                      power in terms of total installed capacity, with a share of more than 50% by 2050, followed
                      by North America (20%) and Europe (10%) (figure: Solar regional).

                      Scaling up solar PV energy investment is critical to accelerating the growth of installations
                      over the coming decades. Globally this would imply a 68% increase in
                      <strong>average annual solar PV investment</strong> from now until 2050 (to USD 192 billion/yr). Solar
                      PV investment stood at USD 114 billion/yr in 2018 (figure: Solar investment).

                      Increasing economies of scale and further technological improvements will continue to reduce the

                      continue to decline in the next three decades. This would make solar PV highly competitive in
                      many markets, with the average falling in the range of USD 340 to 834 per kilowatt (kW) by
                      2030 and USD 165 to 481/kW by 2050, compared to the average of USD 1 210/kW in 2018

                      The <strong>levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) for solar PV</strong> is already competitive compared to
                      all fossil fuel generation sources and is set to decline further as installed costs and performance
                      continue to improve. Globally, the LCOE for solar PV will continue to fall from an average of
                      USD 0.085 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) in 2018 to between USD 0.02 to 0.08/kWh by 2030 and between

                <strong>Tandem and perovskite technologies</strong> also offer interesting perspectives, but in the longer

                              <br class="mb-1">
                                Crystalline silicon (c-Si) panels belong to the first generation solar PV panels and
                                  they hold 95% share of worldwide PV production. The
                                  economies of scale of its main material, silicon, make c-Si more affordable and
                                  highly efficient compared to other materials.
                                  </br>
                                  </br>
                                  The average module efficiency in 2006 was 13.2% for multi crystalline PV panels
                                  and 14.7% for mono crystalline PV panels and since then has increased steadily,
                                  reaching 17% and 18% respectively.
                                  </br>
                                  </br>
                                  However, despite the high-efficiency level of this first-generation PV technology,
                                  there remains a lot of <strong>scope for improvement</strong>, including:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        Lowering the cost of c-Si modules for better profit margins.
		                            </li>

                  <h5 class="mb-1">2. Silicon - advanced solar architecture</h5>
                  <br class="mb-1">
                  <p><strong>a. PERC.</strong> A PERC cell uses advanced silicon cell architecture.
                        </br>
                        </br>
                        PERC cells are not much different in construction from a typical monocrystalline PV cell;
                        however, the <strong>key improvement is the integration of a back-surface passivation layer</strong>,
                        which is a layer of material on the back of the cells that is able to improve the cell’s
                        efficiency. In fact, the passivation layer <strong>increases the overall cell
                        efficiency</strong> in three key ways:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                It reduces electron recombination.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                It increases absorption of light.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                It enables higher internal reflectivity.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        </br>
                        The efficiency gain of implementing PERC architecture for monocrystalline cells is about
                        0.8% to 1% absolute, while the boost for multicrystalline cells is a
                        little lower, at 0.4% to 0.8%.
                        </br>
                        </br>
                        <strong>b. Tandem solar cells are stacks of individual cells, one on top of the other</strong>,
                      that each selectively convert a specific band of light into electrical energy, leaving the
                      remaining light to be absorbed and converted to electricity in the cell below.
                      Emerging PV technologies comprise several types of tandem cells that can be grouped mainly
                      depending on materials used (e.g. organic, inorganic, hybrid) as well as on the kind of connection
                      used. The tandem cell approach has been used to fabricate the world’s most efficient solar
                      cells that can convert 46% of sunlight into electricity.
                    </p>
              </li>
              <li class="list-group-item">
                  <h5 class="mb-1">3. Thin-film.</h5>
                  <br class="mb-1">
                  <p>
                      Thin film technologies are often referred to as second-generation solar PV. The semiconducting
                      materials used to produce thin-film cells are only a few micrometres thick (IRENA, 2016).
                      </br>
                      </br>
                      These technologies generally include <strong>two main families</strong>:

                      <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Silicon-based thin film</strong> (amorphous [a-Si] and micromorph silicon [a-Si/c-Si].
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Non-silicon based</strong> (perovskites, cadmium telluride [CdTe] and copper-indium-gallium diselenide [CIGS]).
                            </li>
                        </ul>
	                  </br>
                      These technologies can be cheaper to produce, as such they are being deployed on a commercial scale, but they have historically had lower efficiency levels.

                  </p>
              </li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Advanced module technologies</h3>
        <p>
            <h5>1. Bifacial solar cells</h5>

            Bifacial solar cells have been under development for decades and their manufacturing process can be
            considered one of the most advanced for solar modules today. Bifacial cells are capable of generating electricity not only from
		    sunlight received on their front, but also from reflected sunlight received on the reverse side of the cell.
            </br>
            </br>
            Bifacial operation, facilitated by the uptake of PERC (which is driving the bifacial boom), offers a near
	        term effective efficiency increase of 5-20% relative by increasing the energy output from a given module area.
            </br>
            </br>
            <h5>2. Multi-busbars</h5>

            Silicon solar cells are metallised with thin strips printed on the front and rear of a solar cell; these are called
	        busbars and have the purpose of conducting the electric direct current (DC) power generated by the cell. Older
            solar cells typically had two busbars; however, the industry has moved towards<strong>higher efficiencies</strong> and
	        busbars have increased to three (or more) in most solar cells.
            </br>
            </br>
            The increased number of busbars has several <strong>advantages</strong>:
            </br>
            </br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    First is the high potential for cost saving due to a reduction in metal consumption for front
                    facing metallisation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Second, series resistance losses are reduced by employing thin wires instead of regular ribbon.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Third, optimising the width of the busbars leads to an additional rise in efficiency.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Finally, multi-busbar design is highly beneficial for bifacial technology, especially for improving the
                    bifaciality for PERC cells of 90%.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h5>3. Solar shingles</h5>

            Solar shingles are a type of solar energy solution where solar panels are designed to look like conventional
	        roofing materials, while also producing electricity.
	        </br>
            </br>
            Solar shingles have several <strong>advantages</strong>.
            </br>
            </br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    First, a key advantage is that they eliminate the need for ribbon, connecting cells like roof tiles.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Second and related to the removal of the ribbon, module aesthetics are improved, as the panels are homogeneously coloured.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Third, unlike a standard cell, cells for shingle modules have busbars at opposite ends and cells are sliced
                    into several strips, which reduces the current and consequently the load on fingers (metallic super-thin
                    grid fingers, perpendicular to the busbar, collecting the generated DC current and delivering it to the busbars).
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

            <h3>Applications: Beyond fields and rooftops</h3>
            <p>
                Taking advantage of the rapidly growing solar PV capacity across the globe, several research projects or
                prototypes are underway to stimulate future market growth, exploring innovating solar technologies at the
                application level. The major developments are as follows.

                  <h5 class="mb-1">1. Floating PV</h5>
                  <p class="mb-1">
                      Floating PV is an exciting emerging market, with the potential for rapid growth. According to a World Bank
                      report, as of the end of September 2018 the global
                      cumulative installed capacity of floating PV plants was
                      1.1 GW (World Bank, 2018).
                      </br>
                      </br>

                      Demand for floating PV is expanding, especially
                      on islands (and other land-constrained countries),
                      because the cost of water surface is generally lower
                      than the cost of land. Floating solar
                      is particularly well suited to Asia, where land is scarce
                      but there are many hydroelectric dams with existing
                      transmission infrastructure.

                  <p class="mb-1">
                      Building-integrated PV (BIPV) solar panels are an application also known as solar shingles (see above).
	                    BIPV solutions have several <strong>advantages</strong>.

                    <ul>
                        <li>First, they are 	<strong>multifunctional</strong> as they can be adapted to a variety of surfaces (e.g. roofs, windows, walls) as an integrated
                            solution, providing both<strong> passive</strong> and<strong> active </strong>functions. A
                            key passive function is thermal and acoustic insulation,
                            as with any other construction material, which is
                            complemented by a unique active function – the PV
                            component – which generates renewable electricity
                            that can be directly used in the building.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Other functions, also unique to BIPV systems, include the
		                    possibility of <strong>real-time thermal or lighting regulation</strong>.
                        </li>

                        An EU-funded project, <strong>PVSITES</strong>, is currently developing
                        a new generation of solar panels that can be part of
                        traditional house elements like roofs, windows and
                        glass façades. The project is creating BIPV solar panels
                        alongside building energy management systems and
                        architectural design tools. The aim is to demonstrate
                        the integration of effective energy production with
                        good design to create cost-effective buildings. The
                        project is also developing design software tools for
                        architects to help them better integrate these novel
                        PV products in their designs.

                      olar trees work very much like real ones, as they have leaf-like solar panels connected through
                      metal branches using sunlight to make energy. Solar trees can be seen as complementary to rooftop solar
                      systems.

                  <p class="mb-1">
                        Solar carports are ground-mounted solar panels that are installed so that parking lots and home driveways
                        can be laid underneath to form a carport. They have
                        been a very popular alternative or supplement to the
                        classic rooftop systems.

                  <p class="mb-1">
                        Solar PV-T systems combine the production of both
                        kinds of solar energy in one collector. It consists of
                        a solar PV panel combined with a cooling system
                        where cooling agent (water or air) is circulated around
                        the PV panels to cool the solar cells, such that the
                        warm water or air leaving the panels may be used
                        for domestic applications such as domestic heating.
                        </br>
                        </br>
                        This cooling system for PV
                      panels has a <strong>twofold benefit</strong>:

                    <ul>
                        <li>It significantly increases
		                    the efficiency of PV systems in the electricity sector.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            It also allows for the capture of the heat from the
                            PV system for use in space, water and process heating
                            in a range of industries and applications.
                        </li>

                    </br>
                    In fact, PV modules normally use 15–20% of the incoming solar
                    energy, while the rest is lost in the form of heat. The
                    PV-T technology aims to increase the overall efficiency
                    by using this “lost” energy to heat air or water and at
                    the same time cool the PV cells by taking away the
                    heat from the panel.

                      Agrophotovoltaic (APV) combines solar PV and agriculture on the same land and consists of growing
                      crops beneath ground-mounted solar panels. Although the concept was proposed long ago, it has received little attention until recently, when several
                      researchers have confirmed the benefits of growing crops beneath the shade provided by the solar panels.

                      <strong>Cultivating crops underneath reduces the temperature of the
                      panels</strong>, as they are cooled down by the fact that the crops below are emitting water through their natural process of transpiration.
